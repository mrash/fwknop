Jonathan Bennett
    - Contributed OpenWRT support - see the extras/openwrt/ directory.

Sebastien Jeanquier
    - Assisted with getting fwknop included in BackTrack Linux - the choice
      distro for pentation testers.

Ozmart
    - Suggested the idea for setting an access stanza expiration time.
    - Suggested the abiliy to have certain incoming connections automatically
      NAT'd through to specific internal systems.  The result was the FORCE_NAT
      mode.
    - Assisted with getting fwknop running under the Pentoo Linux distro.

Max Kastanas
    - Contributed both an Android and an iPhone fwknop client port - see the
      top level android/ and iphone/ directories.

Ted Wynnychenko
    - Helped test fwknop PF support on OpenBSD.

Andy Rowland
    - Reported a bug where the same encryption key used for two stanzas in the
      access.conf file would result in access requests that matched the second
      stanza to always be treated as a replay attack.  This has been fixed for
      the fwknop-2.0.1 release.

C Anthony Risinger
    - Caught a bug where the default PCAP_LOOP_SLEEP value was 1/100th of a
      second instead of the intended default of 1/10th of a second.

Franck Joncourt
    - fwknop Debian package maintainer.
    - Contributed a new Debian init script.

Jonathan Schulz
    - Submitted patches to change HTTP connection type to 'close' for -R mode
      in the client and fix a bug for recv() calls against returned HTTP data.

Aldan Beaubien
    - Reported an issue with the Morpheus client sending SPA packets with NULL
      IP addresses, and code was added to fwknopd to better validate incoming
      SPA data as a result of this report.
