Jonathan Bennett
    - Contributed OpenWRT support - see the extras/openwrt/ directory.

Sebastien Jeanquier
    - Assisted with getting fwknop included in BackTrack Linux - the choice
      distro for pentation testers.

Ozmart
    - Suggested the idea for setting an access stanza expiration time.
    - Suggested the abiliy to have certain incoming connections automatically
      NAT'd through to specific internal systems.  The result was the FORCE_NAT
      mode.
    - Assisted with getting fwknop running under the Pentoo Linux distro.

Max Kastanas
    - Contributed both an Android and an iPhone fwknop client port - see the
      top level android/ and iphone/ directories.

Ted Wynnychenko
    - Helped test fwknop PF support on OpenBSD.

Andy Rowland
    - Reported a bug where the same encryption key used for two stanzas in the
      access.conf file would result in access requests that matched the second
      stanza to always be treated as a replay attack.  This has been fixed for
      the fwknop-2.0.1 release.

C Anthony Risinger
    - Caught a bug where the default PCAP_LOOP_SLEEP value was 1/100th of a
      second instead of the intended default of 1/10th of a second.

Franck Joncourt
    - fwknop Debian package maintainer.
    - Contributed a new Debian init script.

Jonathan Schulz
    - Submitted patches to change HTTP connection type to 'close' for -R mode
      in the client and fix a bug for recv() calls against returned HTTP data.

Aldan Beaubien
    - Reported an issue with the Morpheus client sending SPA packets with NULL
      IP addresses, and code was added to fwknopd to better validate incoming
      SPA data as a result of this report.

Geoff Carstairs
    - Suggested a way to redirect valid connection requests to a specific
      internal service via NAT, configurable by each stanza in access.conf.
      This allows for better access control for multple users requiring access
      to multiple internal systems, in a manner that is transparent to the
      user.  The result was the FORCE_NAT mode.

Hank Leininger
    - For iptables firewalls, suggested a check for the 'comment' match to
      ensure the local environment will properly support fwknopd operations.
      The result is the new ENABLE_IPT_COMMENT_CHECK functionality.

Fernando Arnaboldi (IOActive)
    - Found important buffer overflow conditions for authenticated SPA clients
      in the fwknopd server (pre-2.0.3).  These findings enabled fixes to be
      developed along with a new fuzzing capability in the test suite.
    - Found a condition in which an overly long IP from malicious authenticated
      clients is not properly validated by the fwknopd server (pre-2.0.3).
    - Found a local buffer overflow in --last processing with a maliciously
      constructed ~/.fwknop.run file.  This has been fixed with proper
      validation of .fwknop.run arguments.
    - Found several conditions in which the server did not properly throw out
      maliciously constructed variables in the access.conf file.  This has been
      fixed along with new fuzzing tests in the test suite.
