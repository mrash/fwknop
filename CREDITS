Sebastien Jeanquier
    - Assisted with getting fwknop included in BackTrack Linux - the choice
      distro for pentation testers.

Ozmart
    - Suggested the idea for setting an access stanza expiration time.
    - Suggested the abiliy to have certain incoming connections automatically
      NAT'd through to specific internal systems.  The result was the FORCE_NAT
      mode.
    - Assisted with getting fwknop running under the Pentoo Linux distro.

Max Kastanas
    - Contributed both an Android and an iPhone fwknop client port - see the
      top level android/ and iphone/ directories.

Ted Wynnychenko
    - Helped test fwknop PF support on OpenBSD.

Andy Rowland
    - Reported a bug where the same encryption key used for two stanzas in the
      access.conf file would result in access requests that matched the second
      stanza to always be treated as a replay attack.  This has been fixed for
      the fwknop-2.0.1 release.
