fwknop \- Firewall Knock Operator
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBfwknop\fR implements an authorization scheme known as Single Packet Authorization (SPA) for strong service protection\&. SPA requires only a single packet which is encrypted, non\-replayable, and authenticated via an HMAC in order to communicate desired access to a service that is hidden behind a firewall in a default\-drop filtering stance\&. The main application of SPA is to use a firewall to drop all attempts to connect to services such as \fISSH\fR in order to make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0\-day and unpatched code) more difficult\&. Any service that is protected by SPA naturally cannot be scanned for with \fINmap\fR\&. The fwknop project supports three different firewalls: \fIiptables\fR on Linux systems, \fIpf\fR on OpenBSD, and \fIipfw\fR on FreeBSD and Mac OS X\&.
.sp
SPA is essentially next generation Port Knocking (PK), but solves many of the limitations exhibited by PK while retaining its core benefits\&. PK limitations include a general difficulty in protecting against replay attacks, asymmetric ciphers and HMAC schemes are not usually possible to reliably support, and it is trivially easy to mount a DoS attack against a PK server just by spoofing an additional packet into a PK sequence as it traverses the network (thereby convincing the PK server that the client doesn\(cqt know the proper sequence)\&. All of these limitation are solved by SPA\&. At the same time, SPA hides services behind a default\-drop firewall policy, acquires SPA data passively (usually via libpcap or other means), and implements standard cryptographic operations for SPA packet authentication and encryption/decryption\&.
.sp
This is the manual page for the \fBfwknop\fR client which is responsible for constructing SPA packets and sending them over the network\&. The server side is implemented by the \fBfwknopd\fR daemon which sniffs the network for SPA packets and interacts with the local firewall to allow SPA authenticated connections\&. It is recommended to read the \fIfwknopd(8)\fR manual page as well\&.
.sp
SPA packets generated by \fBfwknop\fR leverage HMAC for authenticated encryption in the encrypt\-then\-authenticate model\&. Although the usage of an HMAC is currently optional (enabled via the \fB\-\-use\-hmac\fR command line switch), it is highly recommended for three reasons: \fI1)\fR without an HMAC, cryptographically strong authentication is not possible with \fBfwknop\fR unless GnuPG is used, but even then an HMAC should still be applied, \fI2)\fR an HMAC applied after encryption protects against cryptanalytic CBC\-mode padding oracle attacks such as the Vaudenay attack and related trickery (like the more recent "Lucky 13" attack against SSL), and \fI3)\fR the code required by the \fBfwknopd\fR daemon to verify an HMAC is much more simplistic than the code required to decrypt an SPA packet, so an SPA packet without a proper HMAC isn\(cqt even sent through the decryption routines\&. Reason \fI3)\fR is why an HMAC should still be used even when SPA packets are encrypted with GnuPG due to the fact that SPA data is not sent through \fBlibgpgme\fR functions unless the HMAC checks out first\&. GnuPG and libgpgme are relatively complex bodies of code, and therefore limiting the ability of a potential attacker to interact with this code through an HMAC operation helps to maintain a stronger security stance\&. Generating an HMAC for SPA communications requires a dedicated key in addition to the normal encryption key, and both can be generated with the \fB\-\-key\-gen\fR option\&.
.sp
\fBfwknop\fR encrypts SPA packets either with the \fIRijndael\fR block cipher or via \fIGnuPG\fR and associated asymmetric cipher\&. If the symmetric encryption method is chosen, then as usual the encryption key is shared between the client and server (see the \fBfwknopd\fR \fI@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access\&.conf\fR file for details)\&. The actual encryption key used for Rijndael encryption is generated via the standard PBKDF1 key derivation algorithm, and CBC mode is set\&. If the GnuPG method is chosen, then the encryption keys are derived from GnuPG key rings\&. SPA packets generated by fwknop running as a client adhere to the following format (before encryption and the HMAC is applied):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    random data (16 bytes)
    username
    timestamp
    software version
    mode (command mode (0) or access mode (1))
    if command mode => command to execute
    else access mode  => IP,proto,port
    message digest (SHA512 / SHA384 / SHA256 / SHA1 / MD5)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Each of the above fields are separated by a ":" character due to the variable length of several of the fields, and those that might contain ":" characters are base64 encoded\&. The message digest (\fBSHA256\fR by default) is part of the data to be encrypted and is independent of the HMAC which is appended to the SPA packet data after encryption\&. The 16 bytes of random data ensures that no two SPA packets are identical, and this is in addition to and independent of using PBKDF1 for key derivation for Rijndael in CBC mode\&. Because \fBfwknopd\fR tracks the SHA256 digest of all incoming valid SPA packets and throws out duplicates, replay attacks are not feasible against \fBfwknop\fR\&. Syslog alerts are generated if a replay is detected\&.
.sp
By default, the \fBfwknop\fR client sends authorization packets over UDP port 62201, but this can be altered with the \fB\-\-server\-port\fR argument (this requires \fBfwknopd\fR to be configured to acquire SPA data over the selected port)\&. Also, \fBfwknop\fR can send the SPA packet over a random port via the \fB\-\-rand\-port\fR argument\&. See \fIfwknopd(8)\fR for further details\&. See the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section for example invocations of the \fBfwknop\fR client\&.
.sp
The \fBfwknop\fR client is quite portable, and is known to run on various Linux distributions (all major distros and embedded ones such as OpenWRT as well), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Cygwin on Windows\&. There is also a library \fBlibfko\fR that both \fBfwknop\fR and \fBfwknopd\fR use for SPA packet encryption/decryption and HMAC authentication operations\&. This library can be used to allow third party applications to use SPA subject to the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL)\&.
.SH "REQUIRED ARGUMENTS"
.sp
These required arguments can be specified via command\-line or from within the \fI~/\&.fwknoprc\fR file (see \fI\-n, \-\-named\-config\fR option and the FWKNOPRC FILE section below)\&.
.PP
\fB\-A, \-\-access\fR=\fI<port list>\fR
.RS 4
Provide a list of ports and protocols to access on a remote computer running
\fBfwknopd\fR\&. The format of this list is \(lq+<proto>/<port>\&...<proto>/<port>+\(rq, e\&.g\&. \(lqtcp/22,udp/53\(rq\&.
\fBNOTE:\fR
The vast majority of usages for
\fBfwknop\fR
require the
\fB\-A\fR
argument, but sending full commands with the
\fB\-\-server\-cmd\fR
argument via an SPA packet to be executed by
\fBfwknopd\fR
does not require this argument\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D, \-\-destination\fR=\fI<hostname/IP\-address>\fR
.RS 4
Direct the
\fBfwknop\fR
client to authenticate with the
\fBfwknopd\fR
daemon/service at the specified destination hostname or IP address\&. The connection mode is discovered by the
\fBfwknopd\fR
daemon/service when it decrypts and parses the authentication packet\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-R|\-a|\-s\fR
.RS 4
One of these options (see below) is required to tell the remote
\fBfwknopd\fR
daemon what IP should be allowed through the local firewall\&. It is recommend to use the
\fB\-R\fR
or
\fB\-a\fR
options instead of
\fB\-s\fR
in order to harden SPA communications against possible
\fIMan\-In\-The\-Middle\fR
(MITM) attacks, and on the server side set
\fIREQUIRE_SOURCE_ADDRESS\fR
variable in the
\fI@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access\&.conf\fR
file\&.
.RE
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Print a usage summary message and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-G, \-\-get\-key\fR=\fI<file>\fR
.RS 4
Load an encryption key/password from the specified file\&. The key file contains a line for each destination hostname or IP address, a colon (":"), optional space and the password, followed by a newline\&. Note that the last line has to have a terminating newline character\&. Also note: though this is a convenience, having a file on your system with clear text passwords is not a good idea and is not recommended\&. Having the
\fBfwknop\fR
client prompt you for the key is generally more secure\&. Note also that if a key is stored on disk, the
\fBfwknop\fR
rc file is a more powerful mechanism for specifying not only the key but other options as well\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stdin\fR
.RS 4
Read the encryption key/password from stdin\&. This can be used to send the data via a pipe for example\&. This command is similar to \-\-fd 0\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fd\fR=\fI<number>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the file descriptor number to read the key/password from\&. This command avoids the user being prompted for his password if none has been found in the user specific stanza, or none has been supplied on the command line\&. A file descriptor set to 0 is similar to the stdin command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-get\-hmac\-key\fR=\fI<file>\fR
.RS 4
Load an HMAC key/password from the specified file\&. Similarly to the format for the
\fB\-\-get\-key\fR
option, the HMAC key file contains a line for each destination hostname or IP address, a colon (":"), optional space and the password, followed by a newline\&. Note that the last line has to have a terminating newline character\&. Also note: though this is a convenience, having a file on your system with clear text passwords is not a good idea and is not recommended\&. Having the
\fBfwknop\fR
client prompt you for the HMAC key is generally more secure\&. Note also that if a key is stored on disk, the
\fBfwknop\fR
rc file is a more powerful mechanism for specifying not only the HMAC key but other options as well\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-key\-gen\fR
.RS 4
Have
\fBfwknop\fR
generate both Rijndael and HMAC keys that can be used for SPA packet encryption\&. These keys are derived from /dev/random and then base64 encoded before being printed to stdout, and are meant to be included within the \(lq$HOME/\&.fwknoprc\(rq file (or the file referenced by
\fB\-\-get\-key\fR)\&. Such keys are generally more secure than passphrases that are typed in from the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-key\-len\fR=\fI<length>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the number of bytes for a generated Rijndael key\&. The maximum size is currently 128 bytes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-hmac\-key\-len\fR=\fI<length>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the number of bytes for a generated HMAC key\&. The maximum size is currently 128 bytes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l, \-\-last\-cmd\fR
.RS 4
Execute
\fBfwknop\fR
with the command\-line arguments from the previous invocation (if any)\&. The previous arguments are parsed out of the
\fI~/\&.fwknop\&.run\fR
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n, \-\-named\-config\fR=\fI<stanza name>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the name of the configuration stanza in the \(lq$HOME/\&.fwknoprc\(rq file to pull configuration and command directives\&. These named stanzas alleviate the need for remembering the various command\-line arguments for frequently used invocations of
\fBfwknop\fR\&. See the section labeled, FWKNOPRC FILE below for a list of the valid configuration directives in the
\fI\&.fwknoprc\fR
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-key\-rijndael\fR=\fI<key>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the Rijndael key on the command line\&. Since the key may be visible to utilities such as
\fIps\fR
under Unix, this form should only be used where security is not critical\&. Having the
\fBfwknop\fR
client either prompt you for the key or acquire via the \(lq$HOME/\&.fwknoprc\(rq file is generally more secure\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-key\-base64\-rijndael\fR=\fI<key>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the base64 encoded Rijndael key\&. Since the key may be visible to utilities such as
\fIps\fR
under Unix, this form should only be used where security is not critical\&. Having the
\fBfwknop\fR
client either prompt you for the key or acquire via the \(lq$HOME/\&.fwknoprc\(rq file is generally more secure\&.
.RE

\fB\-\-key\-base64\-hmac\fR=\fI<key>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the base64 encoded HMAC key\&. Since the key may be visible to utilities such as
\fIps\fR

\fIps\fR
under Unix, this form should only be used where security is not critical\&. Having the
\fBfwknop\fR
client either prompt you for the key or acquire via the \(lq$HOME/\&.fwknoprc\(rq file is generally more secure\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-rc\-file\fR=\fI<file>\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-save\-rc\-stanza\fR=\fI<stanza name>\fR
.RS 4
Save command line arguments to the $HOME/\&.fwknoprc stanza specified with the

Test mode\&. Generate the SPA packet data, but do not send it\&. Instead, print a break\-down of the SPA data fields, then run the data through the decryption and decoding process and print the break\-down again\&. This is primarily a debugging feature\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\fB\-a, \-\-allow\-ip\fR=\fI<IP\-address>\fR
.RS 4
Specify IP address that should be permitted through the destination
\fBfwknopd\fR
server firewall (this IP is encrypted within the SPA packet itself)\&. This is useful to prevent a MITM attack where a SPA packet can be intercepted en\-route and sent from a different IP than the original\&. Hence, if the
\fBfwknopd\fR
server trusts the source address on the SPA packet IP header then the attacker gains access\&. The
\fB\-a\fR
option puts the source address within the encrypted SPA packet, and so thwarts this attack\&. The
\fB\-a\fR
option is also useful to specify the IP that will be granted access when the SPA packet itself is spoofed with the
\fB\-\-spoof\-src\fR
option\&. Another related option is
\fB\-R\fR
(see below) which instructs the
\fBfwknop\fR
client to automatically resolve the externally routable IP address the local system is connected to by querying a website that returns the actual IP address it sees from the calling system\&.
.RE

\fBSHA512\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-N, \-\-nat\-access\fR=\fI<internalIP:forwardPort>\fR
.RS 4
The
\fBfwknopd\fR
server offers the ability to provide SPA access through an iptables firewall to an internal service by interfacing with the iptables NAT capabilities\&. So, if the
\fBfwknopd\fR
server is protecting an internal network on an RFC\-1918 address space, an external
\fBfwknop\fR
client can request that the server port forward an external port to an internal IP, i\&.e\&. \(lq+\-\-NAT\-access 192\&.168\&.10\&.2,55000+\(rq\&. In this case, access will be granted to 192\&.168\&.10\&.2 via port 55000 to whatever service is requested via the
\fB\-\-access\fR
argument (usually tcp/22)\&. Hence, after sending such an SPA packet, one would then do \(lqssh \-p 55000
user@host\(rq and the connection would be forwarded on through to the internal 192\&.168\&.10\&.2 system automatically\&. Note that the port \(lq55000\(rq can be randomly generated via the
\fB\-\-nat\-rand\-port\fR
argument (described later)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-nat\-local\fR
.RS 4
On the
\fBfwknopd\fR
server, a NAT operation can apply to the local system instead of being forwarded through the system\&. That is, for iptables firewalls, a connection to, say, port 55,000 can be translated to port 22 on the local system\&. By making use of the
\fB\-\-nat\-local\fR
argument, the
\fBfwknop\fR
client can be made to request such access\&. This means that any external attacker would only see a connection over port 55,000 instead of the expected port 22 after the SPA packet is sent\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-nat\-port\fR
.RS 4
Usually
\fBfwknop\fR
is used to request access to a specific port such as tcp/22 on a system running
\fBfwknopd\fR\&. However, by using the
\fB\-\-nat\-port\fR
argument, it is possible to request access to a (again, such as tcp/22), but have this access granted via the specified port (so, the
\fB\-p\fR
argument would then be used on the
\fISSH\fR
client command line)\&. See the
\fB\-\-nat\-local\fR

\fB\-\-nat\-access\fR
command line arguments to
\fBfwknop\fR

\fB\-\-nat\-rand\-port\fR
.RS 4
Usually
\fBfwknop\fR
is used to request access to a specific port such as tcp/22 on a system running
\fBfwknopd\fR\&. However, by using the
\fB\-\-nat\-rand\-port\fR
argument, it is possible to request access to a particular service (again, such as tcp/22), but have this access granted via a random translated port\&. That is, once the
\fBfwknop\fR
client has been executed in this mode and the random port selected by
\fBfwknop\fR
is displayed, the destination port used by the follow\-on client must be changed to match this random port\&. For
\fISSH\fR, this is accomplished via the
\fB\-p\fR
argument\&. See the
\fB\-\-nat\-local\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-P, \-\-server\-proto\fR=\fI<protocol>\fR

Set the protocol (udp, tcp, http, udpraw, tcpraw, or icmp) for the outgoing SPA packet\&. Note: The
\fBudpraw\fR,
\fBtcpraw\fR, and
\fBicmp\fR
modes use raw sockets and thus require root access to run\&. Also note: The
\fBtcp\fR
mode expects to establish a TCP connection to the server before sending the SPA packet\&. This is not normally done, but is useful for compatibility with the Tor for strong anonymity; see
\fIhttp://tor\&.eff\&.org/\fR\&. In this case, the
\fBfwknopd\fR
server will need to be configured to listen on the target TCP port (which is 62201 by default)\&.

Spoof the source address from which the

\fBfwknop\fR
client is being used on a system that is behind an obscure NAT address\&. Presently,
\fBfwknop\fR

Because \fBfwknop\fR places the IP to be allowed through the firewall within the encrypted SPA payload (unless \fB\-s\fR is used which is not recommended and can be prohibited in the \fBfwknopd\fR server configuration), SPA packets can easily be spoofed, and this is a good thing in this context\&. That is, the source IP of an SPA packet is ignored by the \fBfwknopd\fR daemon (when the \fIREQUIRE_SOURCE_ADDRESS\fR variable is set in the \fI@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access\&.conf\fR file) and only the IP that is contained within an authenticated and properly decrypted SPA packet is granted access through the firewall\&. This makes it possible to make it appear as though, say, www\&.yahoo\&.com is trying to authenticate to a target system but in reality the actual connection will come from a seemingly unrelated IP\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
The following examples illustrate the command line arguments that could be supplied to the fwknop client in a few situations:
.SS "Quick start"
.sp
The most effective and easiest way to use \fBfwknop\fR is to have the client generate both an encryption key and an HMAC key, and then save them to the \(lq$HOME/\&.fwknoprc\(rq file along with access request specifics\&. The keys will also need to be transferred to the system where \fBfwknopd\fR is running\&. The also client supports a separate set of encryption and HMAC keys for each SPA destination if multiple fwknopd servers are running on different systems\&.
.sp
So, assuming that the IP \fI2\&.2\&.2\&.2\fR is the system where \fBfwknopd\fR is deployed and SSH is protected by the firewall on that system in a default\-drop stance, run the client like so to generate encryption and HMAC keys:
.sp
.if n \{\

.fi
.if n \{\

With the access request arguments and encryption and HMAC keys generated and saved in \(lq$HOME/\&.fwknoprc\(rq, the keys themselves need to be transferred to the \fI2\&.2\&.2\&.2\fR system where fwknopd is running\&. As always, this should be done via some secure means such as SSH before SPA is enabled and SSHD is blocked by the firewall\&. Here is what the new \fI2\&.2\&.2\&.2\fR stanza looks like in the \&.fwknoprc file:

The keys are base64 encoded blobs of random data, and both the \fBKEY_BASE64\fR and \fBHMAC_KEY_BASE64\fR lines should be copied verbatim and placed within the \fI@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access\&.conf\fR file on \fI2\&.2\&.2\&.2\fR\&. Once this is done, \fBfwknopd\fR can be started on that system, a default\-drop policy against SSH connections can be put in place, and then access to SSH is managed via fwknop\&. To access SSH, just use the \fB\-n\fR argument to reference the \fI2\&.2\&.2\&.2\fR stanza out of the \&.fwknoprc file (some \fB\-\-verbose\fR output is included for illustration):

In this case, the SSH connection made to \fI3\&.3\&.3\&.3\fR is translated via NAT to the \fI192\&.168\&.10\&.2\fR system automatically:

.nf
    $ fwknop \-A tcp/22 \-N 192\&.168\&.10\&.2:22 \-R \-D 3\&.3\&.3\&.3

.SH "BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY"
.sp
With the \fI2\&.5\fR release, \fBfwknop\fR underwent significant changes in its usage of cryptography including the addition of support for HMAC authenticated encryption, ensuring the proper usage of PBKDF1 for key derivation when SPA packets are encrypted with Rijndael, and several bugs were fixed from previous versions of fwknop\&. In general, this implies that SPA packets produced by the \fI2\&.5\fR release are incompatible with previous versions of fwknop\&. However, backwards compatibility is supported through setting the \fIlegacy\fR encryption mode with \fB\-M\fR on the fwknop client command line and/or the \fIENCRYPTION_MODE\fR variable in the \fI@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access\&.conf\fR file\&. This way, a pre\-2\&.5 server can decrypt SPA packets produced by a 2\&.5 and later client (set \fI\-M legacy\fR), and a 2\&.5 and later server can decrypt SPA packets produced by pre\-2\&.5 clients (set \fIENCRYPTION_MODE legacy\fR in the access\&.conf file)\&. Note that HMAC is only supported as of 2\&.5 and is an optional feature, so backwards compatibility is only possible for SPA packets that don\(cqt use an HMAC\&. It is recommended to upgrade all fwknop clients and servers to 2\&.5 and use the new HMAC mode for properly authenticated SPA communications\&.
.SH "DEPENDENCIES"
.sp
The \fBfwknop\fR client requires \fIlibfko\fR which is normally included with both source and binary distributions, and is a dedicated library developed by the fwknop project\&. Whenever the \fBfwknopd\fR server is used, \fIlibpcap\fR is a required dependency\&. However, the upcoming \fI2\&.6\fR release will offer a UDP listener mode along with privilege separation support and will not require libpcap in this mode\&. In UDP listener mode, even though fwknopd binds to a UDP port, SPA packets are never acknowledged so from an attacker\(cqs perspective there is no difference between fwknopd sniffing the wire passively vs\&. listening on a UDP socket in terms of what can be scanned for\&.
.sp
For GPG functionality, GnuPG must also be correctly installed and configured along with the \fIlibgpgme\fR library\&.
.sp
To take advantage of all of the authentication and access management features of the \fBfwknopd\fR daemon/service a functioning \fIiptables\fR, \fIipfw\fR, or \fIpf\fR firewall is required on the underlying operating system\&.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
The most comprehensive way to gain diagnostic information on \fBfwknop\fR is to run the test suite \fItest\-fwknop\&.pl\fR script located in the \fItest/\fR directory in the fwknop sources\&. The test suite sends fwknop through a large number of run time tests, has \fIvalgrind\fR support, validates both SPA encryption and HMAC results against OpenSSL, and even has its own built in fuzzer for SPA communications\&. For more basic diagnostic information, \fBfwknop\fR can be executed with the \fB\-T\fR (or \fB\-\-test\fR) command line option\&. This will have \fBfwknop\fR simply create and print the SPA packet information, then run it through a decrypt/decode cycle and print it again\&. In addition, the \fB\-\-verbose\fR command line switch is useful to see various SPA packet specifics printed to stdout\&.
