      (See that file for noteworthy changes)    

Noteworthy changes in 0.34
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Documentation fixes.


Noteworthy changes in 0.33
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Fixed a bug in GnuPG::Interface->import_keys() so that
	it doesn't overwrite your 'command_args' anymore.
	Thanks to  Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org> for
	pointing this out.


Noteworthy changes in 0.32
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Extended the expiration on the test keys another
	4 years so that the test suite works.

    *	Documentation fixes.

    *	Other small cleanups.


Noteworthy changes in 0.31
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Fixed stalling test cases.

    *	Added deprecation support for fields
	of GnuPG::Interface::wrap_call


Noteworthy changes in 0.30
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Re-worked inheritance tree so that GnuPG::SecretKey
	and GnuPG::PublicKey are sub-classes of
	newly-added GnuPG::PrimaryKey.

    *	Tested with GnuPG 1.0.5.

    *	GnuPG::Fingerprint deprecate hex_data(), in favor
	of as_hex_string().

    *	GnuPG::UserId deprecates user_id_string(), in favor
	of as_string().


Noteworthy changes in 0.20
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Fixes for running under Perl 5.6.0
	(stdin, stdout, stderr filehandling changed).
	Thanks to Paul Walmsley, the_shag@users.sourceforge.net

    *	Fix testing so that it works with GnuPG 1.0.4h.

    *	Move a lot of testing code from inside the code
	to outside, so that it doesn't need to be loaded
	along with normal usage.  This might help speed.

    *	License is now the same terms as perl itself.

    *	Don't ship with Class::MethodMaker

Noteworthy changes in 0.11
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	AutoLoader is now used correctly.

    *	GnuPG::Options->no_comment() is no longer exists, for clarity.
	(It doesn't do what you think it does).

    *	GnuPG::Options->comment() will now only not cause
	a --comment option to be used if it's value is undefined.
	This means you can do $gnupg->options->comment( '' )
	to prevent a comment from being used.


Noteworthy changes in 0.10
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	GnuPG::Interface should work fine with the recently-
	released GnuPG 1.0.2.

    *	GnuPG::Handles objects can now handle reading
	or writing directly from already-opened filehandles.
	This can allow a more 'natural' approach to
	having GnuPG read and write directly to files,
	with the exeption being that the user has to
	open these files beforehand.

    *	Documentation created to describe the new accessing
	of open filehandle behaviour, and a FAQ started
	in GnuPG::Interface's docs.

    *	Major code cleanup and other small docs cleanup.


Noteworthy changes in 0.09
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Using GnuPG::Handles which are meant to be dupes
	is now more viable and documented.  In particular,
	file descriptor numbers (properly prefixed, according
	to the open() documentation) can be used.
	This helps when using symbols and and object handles.


Noteworthy changes in 0.08
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	AutoLoader is now used; this may descrease
	compile-time.

    *	Changes so that testing on recent development versions
	of GnuPG (namely 1.0.1e) works, or notably says
	that the error is occuring because of GnuPG version
	differences.


Noteworthy changes in 0.07
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY issue:
	GnuPG::Options->meta_signing_key() now expects
	an argument of type GnuPG::Object, instead of a scalar
	key id.  See the following note for more details.

    *	GnuPG::Options 'meta' methods that deal with keys arguments
	are more consistent now.  Meta methods that accept key
	ids are now appended with _id(s); other meta methods
	that accept keys receive GnuPG::Key objects.


Noteworthy changes in 0.06
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	textmode option added to GnuPG::Options, and
	booleans of GnuPG::Options now make use
	of Class::MethodMaker's boolean usability.


Noteworthy changes in 0.04
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	This is a re-packaging release of 0.03.


Noteworty changes in 0.03
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Documenation fixes.

    *	GnuPG::Option meta-pgp5-compatibility bug fixed.


Noteworty changes in 0.01
