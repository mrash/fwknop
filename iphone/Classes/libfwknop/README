README for the libfwknop directory (iphone/Classes/libfwknop)
===============================================================================

This directory should contain all of the .c and .h files from the fwknop
main distribution "lib" directory. These are the source files for libfko.
You can either manually copy the libfko source files to this directory,
or run the "get_libfko_files.sh script.  Either way, the libfko *.[ch]
files need to exist in this directory before you attempt to build the Iphone
fwknop client.
