# File:    access.conf
#
# Purpose: This file defines how fwknopd will modify firewall access
#          controls for specific IPs/networks.  It gets installed in
#          the fwknop config directory and is consulted by fwknopd on
#          startup or a reconfiguration signal.
#
# Note:    This file supports multiple entries (stanzas) for different
#          levels of access based on the SOURCE of the incoming SPA packet.
#          If multiple stanzas are used, you should make sure they are
#          entered in order from most specific to the more general SOURCE
#          specifications as the first matching SOURCE wins.
#
#          For example, a SOURCE that is a specific IP address should come
#          before a SOURCE that specifies multiple IP's or a Subnet.  The
#          SOURCE: "ANY" should be the last one.
#
#          At least one stanza MUST be defined.
#
##############################################################################
#

# SOURCE: <IP,..,IP/NET,..,NET/ANY>;
#
# This defines the source address from which a SPA packet will be accepted.
# Every  authorization stanza in this file must start  with  the  SOURCE
# keyword. Networks should be specified in CIDR  (e.g. "192.168.10.0/24")
# notation. Individual IP addresses can be specified as well.
#
# Also, multiple IP’s and/or networks can be defined as a comma-separated
# list  (e.g. "192.168.10.0/24,10.1.1.123").
#
# The string "ANY" is also accepted if a valid authorization packet should
# be honored from any source IP.
#

# OPEN_PORTS: <proto/port>, ..., <proto/port>;
#
# Define a set of ports and protocols (tcp or udp) that are allowed to be
# opened if a valid SPA packet is received and its access request matches
# one of the entries here.
#
# If this entry is not set, then fwknopd will attempt to honor the request
# specifed in the SPA data.
#

# RESTRICT_PORTS: <proto/port>, ..., <proto/port>;
#
# Define a set of ports and protocols (tcp or udp) that are *NOT* allowed
# to be opened even if a valid SPA packet is received.
#

# KEY: <8 or more chars>;
#
# Define the key used for decrypting an incoming SPA packet that is using
# its built-in encryption (e.g. not GPG).  This variable is required for
# all non-GPG-encrypted SPA packets.
#

# FW_ACCESS_TIMEOUT: <seconds>;
#
# Define the length of time access will be granted by fwknop through the
# firewall after a valid SPA packet is received from the source IP address
# that matches this stanza's SOURCE.
#
# If  FW_ACCESS_TIMEOUT is not set then the fwknopd default timeout of 60
# seconds will automatically be set.
#

# ENABLE_CMD_EXEC: <Y/N>;
#
# This specifies whether or not fwknopd will accept complete commands that
# are contained within a SPA packet.  Any such command will be executed as
# user specified using the CMD_EXEC_USER parameter by the fwknopd server.
# If not set here, the default is "N".
#

# CMD_EXEC_USER: <username>;
#
# This specifies the user that will execute commands contained within a SPA
# packet.  If not specified, fwknopd will execute it as the user it is
# running as (most likely root). Setting this to a non-root user is highly
# recommended.
#

# CMD_REGEX: <regex>;  **NOT YET SUPPORTED**
#
# If ENABLE_CMD_EXEC is set to "Y" (allowed), and this CMD_REGEX keyword is
# set, it instructs fwknopd to restrict command execution to only commands
# that match the given regular expression.
#

# REQUIRE_USERNAME: <username>;
#
# Require a specific username from the client system as encoded in the SPA
# data.  This variable is optional and if not specified, the username data
# in the SPA data is ignored.
#

# REQUIRE_SOURCE_ADDRESS: <Y/N>;
#
# Force all SPA packets to contain a real IP address within the encrypted
# data.  This makes it impossible to use the "-s" command line argument
# on the fwknop client command line, so either "-R" has to be used to
# automatically resolve the external address (if the client is behind a
# NAT) or the client must know the external IP.  If not set here, the
# default is "N".
#

# GPG_HOME_DIR: <path>;
#
# Define the path to the GnuPG directory to be used by fwknopd.  If this
# keyword is not specified here, then fwknopd will default to using the
# "/root/.gnupg" directory for the server key(s).
#

# GPG_DECRYPT_ID: <keyID>;
#
# Define a GnuPG key ID to use for decrypting SPA messages that have been
# encrypted by an fwknop client using GPG.  This keyword is required for
# authentication that is based on gpg keys.  The gpg key ring on the client
# must have imported and signed the fwknopd server key, and vice versa.
#
# It is ok to use a sensitive personal gpg key on the client, but each
# fwknopd server should have its own gpg key that is generated specifically
# for fwknop communications.  The reason for this is that this decryption
# password within this file.
#
# Note that you can use either keyID or its corresponding email address.
#
# For more information on using fwknop with GnuPG keys, see the following
# link: http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/docs/gpghowto.html
#

# GPG DECRYPT_PW: <decrypt password>;
#
# Specify the decryption password for the gpg key defined by the
# GPG_DECRYPT_ID above.  This is a required field for gpg-based
# authentication.
#

# GPG_REMOTE_ID: <keyID,...,keyID>;
#
# Define a list of gpg key ID’s that are required to have signed any
# incoming SPA messages that have been encrypted with the fwknopd server
# key.
#
# This ensures that the verification of the remote user is accomplished
# via a strong cryptographic mechanism.
#
# Note that you can use either keyIDs or their corresponding email addresses.
