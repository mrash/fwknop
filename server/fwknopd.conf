#         [+] fwknopd - Firewall Knock Operator Daemon [+]
#
# This is the configuration file for fwknopd, the Firewall Knock Operator
# daemon.  The primary authentication and authorization mechanism offered
# by fwknop is known as Single Packet Authorization (SPA).  More information
# about SPA can be found at: http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/docs/SPA.html
#
# Note there are no access control directives in this file.  All access
# control directives are located in the file "/etc/fwknop/access.conf".
# You will need to edit the access.conf file in order for fwknop to function
# correctly.
#

# Machine hostname. If not set, fwknopd will attempt to use gethostname()
# to determine the local hostname and use that.
#
#HOSTNAME                    _CHANGEME_;

# Define the firewall type.  The default is "iptables" for Linux systems,
# but this can be set to "ipfw" for *BSD systems.  Also supported is
# "external_cmd" to allow fwknop to invoke an external command instead of
# interfacing with the firewall at all.
#
# NOTE: At present, only "iptables" is supported.
#
FIREWALL_TYPE               iptables;

# This defines the general strategy fwknop uses to authenticate remote
# clients.  Possible values are "PCAP" (authenticate via regular pcap; this
# is the default and puts the interface in promiscuous mode unless
# ENABLE_PCAP_PROMISC is turned off) FILE_PCAP (authenticate via a pcap file
# that is built by a sniffer), ULOG_PCAP (authenticate via the ulogd pcap
# writer).
#
# NOTE: At present, only "PCAP" supported.
#
AUTH_MODE                   PCAP;

# that this is only used if the AUTH_MODE keyword above is set to
# "PCAP".

# By default fwknopd puts the pcap interface into promiscuous mode. Set
# this to 'N' to disable that behavior (non-promiscuous).
#
ENABLE_PCAP_PROMISC         Y;

# Define the filter used for PCAP modes; we default to udp port 62201.
# However, if an fwknop client uses the --rand-port option to send the
# SPA packet over a random port, then this variable should be updated to
# something like "udp dst portrange 10000-65535;".
#
PCAP_FILTER                 udp port 62201;

# This instructs fwknopd to not honor SPA packets that have an old time
# stamp.  The value for "old" is defined by the MAX_SPA_PACKET_AGE variable.
# If ENABLE_SPA_PACKET_AGING is set to "N", fwknopd will not use the client
# time stamp at all.
#
ENABLE_SPA_PACKET_AGING     Y;

# Defines the maximum age (in seconds) that an SPA packet will be accepted.
# This requires that the client system is in relatively close time
# synchronization with the fwknopd server system (NTP is good).  The default
# age is two minutes.
# 
MAX_SPA_PACKET_AGE          120;

# Track digest sums associated with previous fwknop process.  This allows
# digest sums to remain persistent across executions of fwknop.
#
ENABLE_DIGEST_PERSISTENCE   Y;

# Allow SPA clients to request access to services through an iptables
# firewall instead of just to it (i.e. access through the FWKNOP_FORWARD
# chain instead of the INPUT chain). This also requires the
# ENABLE_FORWARD_ACCESS variable to be set in the access.conf file for the
# specific SOURCE stanzas that should be allowed for forwarding access.
#
ENABLE_IPT_FORWARDING       N;

# Allow SPA clients to request access to a local socket via NAT.  This still
# puts an ACCEPT rule into the FWKNOP_INPUT chain, but a different port is
# translated via DNAT rules to the real one.  So, the user would do
# "ssh -p <port>" to access the local service (see the --NAT-local and
# --NAT-rand-port on the fwknop client command line).
#
ENABLE_IPT_LOCAL_NAT        Y;

# By default, if forwarding access is enabled (see the ENABLE_IPT_FORWARDING
# variable above), then fwknop creates DNAT rules for incoming connections,
# but does not also complement these rules with SNAT rules at the same time.
# In some situations, internal systems may not have a route back out for the
# source address of the incoming connection, so it is necessary to also
# apply SNAT rules so that the internal systems see the IP of the internal
# interface where fwknopd is running.  This functionality is only enabled
# when ENABLE_IPT_SNAT is set to "Y", and by default SNAT rules are built
# with the MASQUERADE target (since then the internal IP does not have to be
# defined here in the fwknop.conf file), but if you want fwknopd to use the
# SNAT target then also defined an IP address with the SNAT_TRANSLATE_IP
# variable.

# disables forwarding, then by default enable forwarding
#

# if there are no state tracking rules to allow connection responses out and
# the OUTPUT chain has a default-drop stance.

# The following four variables control whether a global set of "open" and
# "close" commands are executed after receving a valid SPA packet.  These
# variables are used only if FIREWALL_TYPE is set to "external_cmd", but
# the same variables can also exist within the access.conf file so that
# mixed deployments are possible - that is, some SPA packets will operate
# as usual and result in firewall commands being executed, but others will
# result in the commands defined by these variables (in access.conf) being
# executed.
#     The "open" and "close" commands might be manually supplied firewall
# commands, and both support variable substitution of any of the variables
# in the access.conf file with "$VAR".  Also, three special variables are
# supported: $SRC, $PORT, and $PROTO, which are derived from actual values
# from within valid SPA packets (as opposed to $SOURCE from access.conf
# which may contain a list of networks instead of a single IP address).
# Here are some examples:
#     - Execute a specific iptables command on behalf of the source IP
#     in a valid SPA packet to add a new ACCEPT rule, and execute
#     another command (to delete the same rule after a timeout):
#         EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN       iptables -A INPUT -s $SRC -j ACCEPT
#         EXTERNAL_CMD_CLOSE      iptables -D INPUT -s $SRC -j ACCEPT
#     - Execute a custom binary with the SOURCE and OPEN_PORTS variables
#     from the access.conf file as input on the command line, and after
#     a timeout execute a different program but use the real SPA source
#     IP:
#         EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN       /path/someprog $SOURCE $OPEN_PORTS
#         EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN       /path/otherprog $SRC
#
#ENABLE_EXTERNAL_CMDS        N;
#EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN           __NONE__;
#EXTERNAL_CMD_CLOSE          __NONE__;
#EXTERNAL_CMD_ALARM          30;

# if EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN is used above, then the following two variables can
# be used to enforce a prefix on variable substitutions - useful if there
# are any naming conflicts with the external script and command line
# arguments that are named the same as the variables to be substituted.
#
#ENABLE_EXT_CMD_PREFIX       N;
#EXT_CMD_PREFIX              FWKNOP_;

# fwknopd adds allow rules to a custom iptables chain "FWKNOP_INPUT".
# This chain is called from the INPUT chain, and by default no other
# iptables chains are used.  However, additional chains can be added
# (say, if access needs to be allowed through the local system via the
# FORWARD chain) by altering the IPT_FORWARD_ACCESS variable below.
# For a discussion of the format followed by these keywords, read on:
#
# Specify chain names to which iptables blocking rules will be
# added with the IPT_INPUT_ACCESS and IPT_FORWARD_ACCESS keyword.
# The format for these variables is:
#
#   <Target>,<Direction>,<Table>,<From_chain>,<Jump_rule_position>,\
#       <To_chain>,<Rule_position>.
#
# "Target":
#   Can be any legitimate iptables target, but should usually just be "DROP".
#
# "Direction":
#   Can be "src", "dst", or "both", which correspond to the INPUT, OUTPUT,
#   and FORWARD chains.
#
# "Table":
#   Can be any iptables table, but the default is "filter".
#
# "From_chain":
#   Is the chain from which packets will be jumped.
#
# "Jump_rule_position":
#   Defines the position within the From_chain where the jump rule is added.
#
# "To_chain":
#   Is the chain to which packets will be jumped. This is the main chain
#   where fwknop rules are added.
#
# "Rule_position":
#   Defines the position where rule are added within the To_chain.
