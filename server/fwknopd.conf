#         [+] fwknopd - Firewall Knock Operator Daemon [+]
#
# This is the configuration file for fwknopd, the Firewall Knock Operator
# daemon.  The primary authentication and authorization mechanism offered
# by fwknop is known as Single Packet Authorization (SPA).  More information
# about SPA can be found at: http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/docs/SPA.html
#
# There are no access control directives in this file.  All access
# control directives are located in the file "/etc/fwknop/access.conf".
# You will need to edit the access.conf file in order for fwknop to function
# correctly.
#
# Most of these can remain commented out unless you need to overide the
# default setting.
#
# It is also important to note that there are some subtle (and some not
# so subtle) differences between this configuration file, its parameters
# and valid values and the configuration file used by the legacy Perl
# version  of fwknopd.  Please pay careful attention to the format and
# values used in this file if you are migrating from the legacy Perl
# version.

# Define the default verbosity level the fwknop server should use.
# A value of "0" is the default verbosity level. Setting it up to "1" or
# higher will allow debugging messges be displayed.
#
#VERBOSE                     0;

# Define the ethernet interface on which we will sniff packets.
# Default if not set is eth0.  The '-i <intf>' command line option overrides
# the PCAP_INTF setting.
#
#PCAP_INTF                   eth0;

# By default fwknopd does not put the pcap interface into promiscuous mode.
# Set this to 'Y' to enable promiscuous sniffing.
#
#ENABLE_PCAP_PROMISC         N;

# Define the filter used for PCAP modes; we default to udp port 62201.
# However, if an fwknop client uses the --rand-port option to send the
# SPA packet over a random port, then this variable should be updated to
# something like "udp dst portrange 10000-65535;".
# Default is "udp port 62201".
#
#PCAP_FILTER                 udp port 62201;

# This instructs fwknopd to not honor SPA packets that have an old time
# stamp.  The value for "old" is defined by the MAX_SPA_PACKET_AGE variable.
# If ENABLE_SPA_PACKET_AGING is set to "N", fwknopd will not use the client
# time stamp at all.
#
#ENABLE_SPA_PACKET_AGING     Y;

# Defines the maximum age (in seconds) that an SPA packet will be accepted.
# This requires that the client system is in relatively close time
# synchronization with the fwknopd server system (NTP is good).  The default
# age is two minutes.

# digest sums to remain persistent across executions of fwknop.
#
#ENABLE_DIGEST_PERSISTENCE   Y;

# Sets the number of packets that are processed when the pcap_dispatch()
# call is made.  The default is zero, since this allows fwknopd to process
# as many packets as possible in the corresponding callback where the SPA
# handling routine is called for packets that pass a set of prerequisite
# checks.  However, if fwknopd is running on a platform with an old
# version of libpcap, it may be necessary to change this value to a positive
# non-zero integer.  More information can be found in the pcap_dispatch(3)
# man page.
#PCAP_DISPATCH_COUNT            0;

# Sets the number of microseconds to passed as an argument to usleep() in

# Enable the fwknopd TCP server.  This is a "dummy" TCP server that will
# accept TCP connection requests on the specified TCPSERV_PORT.
# If set to "Y", fwknopd will fork off a child process to listen for, and
# accept incoming TCP request.  This server only accepts the
# request.  It does not otherwise communicate. This is only to allow the
# incoming SPA over TCP packet which is detected via PCAP. The connection
# is closed after 1 second regardless.
# Note that fwknopd still only gets its data via pcap, so the filter
# defined by PCAP_FILTER needs to be updated to include this TCP port.

# a live interface.  This is usually only used for debugging purposes, and is
# equivalent to the '-r <pcap file>' command line option.
#
#PCAP_FILE                   /some/path/to/file.pcap;

# This variable controls whether fwknopd is permitted to sniff SPA packets
# regardless of whether they are received on the sniffing interface or sent
# from the sniffing interface.  In the later case, this can be useful to have
# fwknopd sniff SPA packets that are forwarded through a system and destined
# for a different network.  If the sniffing interface is the egress interface
# for such packets, then this variable will need to be set to "Y" in order for
# fwknopd to see them.  The default is "N" so that fwknopd only looks for SPA
# packets that are received on the sniffing interface (note that this is
# independent of promiscuous mode).
#
# ENABLE_PCAP_ANY_DIRECTION     N;

# Controls whether fwknopd will set the destination field on the firewall
# rule to the destination address specified on the incoming SPA packet. 
# This is useful for interfaces with multiple IP addresses hosting separate
# services. If ENABLE_IPT_OUTPUT is set to "Y", the source field of 
# the firewall rule is set. FORWARD and SNAT rules are not affected however, 
# DNAT rules will also have their destination field set. The default is 
# "N", which sets the destination field to 0.0.0.0/0 (any).
#
# ENABLE_DESTINATION_RULE       Y;

##############################################################################
# NOTE: The following EXTERNAL_CMD functionality is not yet implemented.
#       This is a possible future feature of fwknopd.
#
# The following four variables control whether a global set of "open" and
# "close" commands are executed after receving a valid SPA packet.  These
# variables are used only if FIREWALL_TYPE is set to "external_cmd", but
# the same variables can also exist within the access.conf file so that
# mixed deployments are possible - that is, some SPA packets will operate
# as usual and result in firewall commands being executed, but others will
# result in the commands defined by these variables (in access.conf) being
# executed.
#     The "open" and "close" commands might be manually supplied firewall
# commands, and both support variable substitution of any of the variables
# in the access.conf file with "$VAR".  Also, three special variables are
# supported: $SRC, $PORT, and $PROTO, which are derived from actual values
# from within valid SPA packets (as opposed to $SOURCE from access.conf
# which may contain a list of networks instead of a single IP address).
# Here are some examples:
#     - Execute a specific iptables command on behalf of the source IP
#     in a valid SPA packet to add a new ACCEPT rule, and execute
#     another command (to delete the same rule after a timeout):
#         EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN       iptables -A INPUT -s $SRC -j ACCEPT
#         EXTERNAL_CMD_CLOSE      iptables -D INPUT -s $SRC -j ACCEPT
#     - Execute a custom binary with the SOURCE and OPEN_PORTS variables
#     from the access.conf file as input on the command line, and after
#     a timeout execute a different program but use the real SPA source
#     IP:
#         EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN       /path/someprog $SOURCE $OPEN_PORTS
#         EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN       /path/otherprog $SRC
#

#EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN           __NONE__;
#EXTERNAL_CMD_CLOSE          __NONE__;
#EXTERNAL_CMD_ALARM          30;

# if EXTERNAL_CMD_OPEN is used above, then the following two variables can
# be used to enforce a prefix on variable substitutions - useful if there
# are any naming conflicts with the external script and command line
# arguments that are named the same as the variables to be substituted.
