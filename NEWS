Noteworthy changes in version 2.5 (2013-06-16)
-------------------------------------------------------

 * HMAC support for authenticated encryption (works for both Rijndael and GPG)

 * Update to how fwknop leverages Rijndael including the usage of the PBKDF1
   algorithm for key derivation, truncation bug fixes, more careful handling
   of buffers used in cryptographic operations, and more.

 * The fwknop code base is now audited with the excellent Coverity static
   analysis product, and many bugs were fixed as a result.  Full details can be
   found in the git log.

 * The test suite can now cross compare how fwknop encrypts and authenticates
   SPA data with OpenSSL.  This is a powerful verification step since it
   essentially allows fwknop to take advantage of the OpenSSL library and all
   of the research that goes into it without having to link against OpenSSL
   directly.  (OpenSSL does far more than fwknop would ever need.)

 * A new work flow is made possible through the ability to save encryption
   keys, HMAC keys, and command line arguments to the ~/.fwknoprc file.  This
   greatly simplifies fwknop command line usage just by using the stanza name
   for access to a remote service '$ fwknop -n <stanza name>'.

Noteworthy changes prior to fwknop-2.5 can be found in the ChangeLog.
