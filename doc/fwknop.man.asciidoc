NAME
----
fwknop - Firewall Knock Operator


SYNOPSIS
--------
*fwknop* *-A* <'proto/ports'> *-R*|*-a*|*-s -D* <'host'> ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fwknop* implements an authorization scheme known as Single Packet
Authorization (SPA) for strong service concealment.  SPA requires only a single
packet which is encrypted, non-replayable, and authenticated via an HMAC in order
to communicate desired access to a service that is hidden behind a firewall in a
default-drop filtering stance.  The main application of SPA is to use a
firewall to drop all attempts to connect to services such as 'SSH' in order
to make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code)
more difficult.  Any service that is concealed by SPA naturally cannot be
scanned for with 'Nmap'.  The fwknop project supports three different
firewalls: 'iptables' on Linux systems, 'pf' on OpenBSD, and 'ipfw' on FreeBSD
and Mac OS X.

SPA is essentially next generation Port Knocking (PK), but solves many of the
limitations exhibited by PK while retaining its core benefits.  PK limitations
include a general difficulty in protecting against replay attacks, asymmetric
ciphers and HMAC schemes are not usually possible to reliably support, and it
is trivially easy to mount a DoS attack against a PK server just by spoofing an
additional packet into a PK sequence as it traverses the network (thereby convincing the
PK server that the client doesn't know the proper sequence).  All of these
limitation are solved by SPA.  At the same time, SPA hides services behind a
default-drop firewall policy, acquires SPA data passively (usually via
libpcap or other means), and implements standard cryptographic operations
for SPA packet authentication and encryption/decryption.

This is the manual page for the *fwknop* client which is responsible for
constructing SPA packets and sending them over the network.  The server side is
implemented by the *fwknopd* daemon which sniffs the network for SPA packets
and interacts with the local firewall to allow SPA authenticated connections.
It is recommended to read the 'fwknopd(8)' manual page as well.

SPA packets generated by *fwknop* leverage HMAC for authenticated encryption
in the encrypt-then-authenticate model.  Although the usage of an HMAC is
currently optional (enabled via the *--use-hmac* command line switch), it is
highly recommended for three reasons: '1)' without an HMAC, cryptographically
strong authentication is not possible with *fwknop* unless GnuPG is used, but
even then an HMAC should still be applied, '2)' an HMAC applied after
encryption protects against cryptanalytic CBC-mode padding oracle attacks such
as the Vaudenay attack and related trickery (like the more recent "Lucky 13"
attack against SSL), and '3)' the code required by the *fwknopd* daemon to
verify an HMAC is much more simplistic than the code required to decrypt an SPA
packet, so an SPA packet without a proper HMAC isn't even sent through the
decryption routines.  Reason '3)' is why an HMAC should still be used even when
SPA packets are encrypted with GnuPG due to the fact that SPA data is not sent
through *libgpgme* functions unless the HMAC checks out first.  GnuPG and
libgpgme are relatively complex bodies of code, and therefore limiting the
ability of a potential attacker to interact with this code through an HMAC
operation helps to maintain a stronger security stance.  Generating an
HMAC for SPA communications requires a dedicated key in addition to the normal
encryption key, and both can be generated with the *--key-gen* option.

*fwknop* encrypts SPA packets either with the 'Rijndael' block cipher or via
'GnuPG' and associated asymmetric cipher.  If the symmetric encryption method
is chosen, then as usual the encryption key is shared between the client and
server (see the *fwknopd* '@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access.conf' file for details).  The actual
encryption key used for Rijndael encryption is generated via the standard
PBKDF1 key derivation algorithm, and CBC mode is set.  If the GnuPG method
is chosen, then the encryption keys are derived from GnuPG key rings.  SPA
packets generated by fwknop running as a client adhere to the following
format (before encryption and the HMAC is applied):

..........................
    random data (16 bytes)
    username
    timestamp
    software version
    mode (command mode (0) or access mode (1))
    if command mode => command to execute
    else access mode  => IP,proto,port
    message digest (SHA512 / SHA384 / SHA256 / SHA1 / MD5)
..........................

Each of the above fields are separated by a ":" character due to the variable
length of several of the fields, and those that might contain ":" characters
are base64 encoded.  The message digest (*SHA256* by default) is part of the
data to be encrypted and is independent of the HMAC which is appended to the
SPA packet data after encryption.  The 16 bytes of random data ensures that no
two SPA packets are identical, and this is in addition to and independent of
using PBKDF1 for key derivation for Rijndael in CBC mode.  Because *fwknopd*
tracks the SHA256 digest of all incoming valid SPA packets and throws out
duplicates, replay attacks are not feasible against *fwknop*.  Syslog
alerts are generated if a replay is detected.

By default, the *fwknop* client sends authorization packets over UDP port
62201, but this can be altered with the *--server-port* argument (this requires
*fwknopd* to be configured to acquire SPA data over the selected port).
Also, *fwknop* can send the SPA packet over a random port via the
*--rand-port* argument. See 'fwknopd(8)' for further details. See the
*EXAMPLES* section for example invocations of the *fwknop* client.

The *fwknop* client is quite portable, and is known to run on various Linux
distributions (all major distros and embedded ones such as OpenWRT as well),
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Cygwin on Windows.  There is also a library *libfko*
that both *fwknop* and *fwknopd* use for SPA packet encryption/decryption
and HMAC authentication operations.  This library can be used to allow
third party applications to use SPA subject to the terms of the GNU
Public License (GPL).


REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
------------------
These required arguments can be specified via command-line or from within
the '~/.fwknoprc' file (see '-n, --named-config' option and the FWKNOPRC FILE
section below).

*-A, --access*='<port list>'::
    Provide a list of ports and protocols to access on a remote computer
    running *fwknopd*.  The format of this list is
    ``+<proto>/<port>...<proto>/<port>+'', e.g. ``tcp/22,udp/53''. *NOTE:*
    The vast majority of usages for *fwknop* require the *-A* argument, but
    sending full commands with the *--server-cmd* argument via an SPA
    packet to be executed by *fwknopd* does not require this argument.

*-D, --destination*='<hostname/IP-address>'::
    Direct the *fwknop* client to authenticate with the *fwknopd*
    daemon/service at the specified destination hostname or IP address. The
    connection mode is discovered by the *fwknopd* daemon/service when it
    decrypts and parses the authentication packet.

*-R|-a|-s*::
    One of these options (see below) is required to tell the remote
    *fwknopd* daemon what IP should be allowed through the local firewall.  It
    is recommend to use the *-R* or *-a* options instead of *-s* in order
    to harden SPA communications against possible 'Man-In-The-Middle' (MITM)
    attacks, and on the server side set 'REQUIRE_SOURCE_ADDRESS' variable in
    the '@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access.conf' file.  Note that the most secure
    option is *-a* so that *fwknop* does not have to issue an HTTP request to
    'http://www.cipherdyne.org/cgi-bin/myip' in order to resolve the externally
    routable IP address.  Using *-a* requires that the user already knows what
    the external IP is for the network where fwknop is running.


GENERAL OPTIONS
---------------
*-h, --help*::
    Print a usage summary message and exit.

*-G, --get-key*='<file>'::
    Load an encryption key/password from the specified file.  The key file
    contains a line for each destination hostname or IP address, a colon
    (":"), optional space and the password, followed by a newline.  Note
    that the last line has to have a terminating newline character.
    Also note: though this is a convenience, having a file on your system
    with clear text passwords is not a good idea and is not recommended.
    Having the *fwknop* client prompt you for the key is generally more
    secure.  Note also that if a key is stored on disk, the *fwknop* rc
    file is a more powerful mechanism for specifying not only the key but
    other options as well.

*--stdin*::
    Read the encryption key/password from stdin. This can be used to send
    the data via a pipe for example. This command is similar to --fd 0.

*--fd*='<number>'::
    Specify the file descriptor number to read the key/password from. This
    command avoids the user being prompted for a password if none has been
    found in the user specific stanza, or none has been supplied on the
    command line. A file descriptor set to 0 is similar to the stdin command.

*--get-hmac-key*='<file>'::
    Load an HMAC key/password from the specified file.  Similarly to the
    format for the *--get-key* option, the HMAC key file contains a line for
    each destination hostname or IP address, a colon (":"), optional space
    and the password, followed by a newline.  Note that the last line has
    to have a terminating newline character.  Also note: though this is a
    convenience, having a file on your system with clear text passwords is
    not a good idea and is not recommended.  Having the *fwknop* client
    prompt you for the HMAC key is generally more secure.  Note also that
    if a key is stored on disk, the *fwknop* rc file is a more powerful
    mechanism for specifying not only the HMAC key but other options as
    well.

*--key-gen*::
    Have *fwknop* generate both Rijndael and HMAC keys that can be used for SPA
    packet encryption.  These keys are derived from /dev/urandom and then base64
    encoded before being printed to stdout, and are meant to be included within
    the ``$HOME/.fwknoprc'' file (or the file referenced by *--get-key*).  Such
    keys are generally more secure than passphrases that are typed in from the
    command line.

*--key-len*='<length>'::
    Specify the number of bytes for a generated Rijndael key.  The maximum size
    is currently 128 bytes.

*--hmac-key-len*='<length>'::
    Specify the number of bytes for a generated HMAC key.  The maximum size is
    currently 128 bytes.

*-l, --last-cmd*::
    Execute *fwknop* with the command-line arguments from the previous
    invocation (if any).  The previous arguments are parsed out of the
    '~/.fwknop.run' file.

*-n, --named-config*='<stanza name>'::
    Specify the name of the configuration stanza in the ``$HOME/.fwknoprc''
    file to pull configuration and command directives.  These named stanzas
    alleviate the need for remembering the various command-line arguments
    for frequently used invocations of *fwknop*. See the section labeled,
    FWKNOPRC FILE below for a list of the valid configuration directives in
    the '.fwknoprc' file.

*--key-rijndael*='<key>'::
    Specify the Rijndael key on the command line. Since the key may be visible
    to utilities such as 'ps' under Unix, this form should only be used where
    security is not critical.  Having the *fwknop* client either prompt you for
    the key or acquire via the ``$HOME/.fwknoprc'' file is generally more
    secure.

*--key-base64-rijndael*='<key>'::
    Specify the base64 encoded Rijndael key. Since the key may be visible
    to utilities such as 'ps' under Unix, this form should only be used where
    security is not critical.  Having the *fwknop* client either prompt you for
    the key or acquire via the ``$HOME/.fwknoprc'' file is generally more
    secure.

*--key-base64-hmac*='<key>'::
    Specify the base64 encoded HMAC key. Since the key may be visible
    to utilities such as 'ps' under Unix, this form should only be used where
    security is not critical.  Having the *fwknop* client either prompt you for
    the key or acquire via the ``$HOME/.fwknoprc'' file is generally more
    secure.

*--key-hmac*='<key>'::
    Specify the raw HMAC key (not base64 encoded). Since the key may be visible
    to utilities such as 'ps' under Unix, this form should only be used where
    security is not critical.  Having the *fwknop* client either prompt you for
    the key or acquire via the ``$HOME/.fwknoprc'' file is generally more
    secure.

*--rc-file*='<file>'::
    Specify path to the fwknop rc file (default is $HOME/.fwknoprc).

*--save-rc-stanza*='<stanza name>'::
    Save command line arguments to the $HOME/.fwknoprc stanza specified with
    the *-n* option.  If the *-n* option is omitted, then the stanza name will
    default to the destination server value (hostname or IP) given with the
    *-D* argument.

*--force-stanza*::
    Used with *--save-rc-stanza* to overwrite all of the variables for the
    specified stanza

*--stanza-list*::
    Dump a list of the stanzas found in $HOME/.fwknoprc.

*--show-last*::
    Display the last command-line arguments used by *fwknop*.

*-E, --save-args-file*='<file>'::
    Save command line arguments to a specified file path.  Without this
    option, and when *--no-save-args* is not also specified, then the default
    save args path is '~/.fwknop.run'.

*--no-save-args*::
    Do not save the command line arguments given when *fwknop* is executed.

*-T, --test*::
    Test mode.  Generate the SPA packet data, but do not send it.  Instead,
    print a break-down of the SPA data fields, then run the data through
    the decryption and decoding process and print the break-down again.
    This is primarily a debugging feature.

*-B, --save-packet*='<file>'::
    Instruct the *fwknop* client to write a newly created SPA packet out
    to the specified file so that it can be examined off-line.

*-b, --save-packet-append*::
    Append the generated packet data to the file specified with the *-B*
    option.

*-v, --verbose*::
    Run the *fwknop* client in verbose mode.  This causes *fwknop* to print
    some extra information about the current command and the resulting SPA
    data.

*-V, --version*::
    Display version information and exit.


SPA OPTIONS
-----------
*--use-hmac*::
    Set HMAC mode for authenticated encryption of SPA communications.  As of
    *fwknop* 2.5, this is an optional feature, but this will become the
    default in a future release.

*-a, --allow-ip*='<IP-address>'::
    Specify IP address that should be permitted through the destination
    *fwknopd* server firewall (this IP is encrypted within the SPA packet
    itself).  This is useful to prevent a MITM attack where a SPA packet
    can be intercepted en-route and sent from a different IP than the
    original.  Hence, if the *fwknopd* server trusts the source address
    on the  SPA  packet IP header then the attacker gains access.
    The *-a* option puts the source address within the encrypted SPA
    packet, and so thwarts this attack.  The *-a* option is also
    useful to specify the IP that will be granted access when the
    SPA packet itself is spoofed with the *--spoof-src* option.  Another
    related option is *-R* (see below) which instructs the *fwknop* client
    to automatically resolve the externally routable IP address the local
    system is connected to by querying a website that returns the actual
    IP address it sees from the calling system.

*-g, --gpg-encryption*::
    Use GPG encryption on the SPA packet (default if not specified is
    Rijndael). *Note:* Use of this option will also require a GPG recipient
    (see *--gpg-recipient* along with other GPG-related options below).

*--hmac-digest-type*='<digest>'::
    Set the HMAC digest algorithm for authenticated encryption of SPA packets.
    Choices are: *MD5*, *SHA1*, *SHA256* (the default), *SHA384*, and *SHA512*.

*-N, --nat-access*='<internalIP:forwardPort>'::
    The *fwknopd* server offers the ability to provide SPA access through
    an iptables firewall to an internal service by interfacing with the
    iptables NAT capabilities.  So, if the *fwknopd* server is protecting
    an internal network on an RFC-1918 address space, an external *fwknop*
    client can request that the server port forward an external port to an
    internal IP, i.e. ``+--NAT-access 192.168.10.2,55000+''.  In this case,
    access will be granted to 192.168.10.2 via port 55000 to whatever
    service is requested via the *--access* argument (usually tcp/22).
    Hence, after sending such an SPA packet, one would then do
    ``ssh -p 55000 user@host'' and the connection would be forwarded on
    through to the internal 192.168.10.2 system automatically.  Note that
    the port ``55000'' can be randomly generated via the *--nat-rand-port*
    argument (described later).

*--nat-local*::
    On the *fwknopd* server, a NAT operation can apply to the local system
    instead of being forwarded through the system.  That is, for iptables
    firewalls, a connection to, say, port 55,000 can be translated to port
    22 on the local system.  By making use of the *--nat-local* argument,
    the *fwknop* client can be made to request such access.  This means
    that any external attacker would only see a connection over port 55,000
    instead of the expected port 22 after the SPA packet is sent.

*--nat-port*::
    Usually *fwknop* is used to request access to a specific port such as
    tcp/22 on a system running *fwknopd*.  However, by using the *--nat-port*
    argument, it is possible to request access to a (again, such as tcp/22),
    but have this access granted via the specified port (so, the *-p* argument
    would then be used on the 'SSH' client command line).  See the
    *--nat-local* and *--nat-access* command line arguments to *fwknop* for
    additional details on gaining access to services via a NAT operation.

*--nat-rand-port*::
    Usually *fwknop* is used to request access to a specific port such as
    tcp/22 on a system running *fwknopd*.  However, by using the
    *--nat-rand-port* argument, it is possible to request access to a
    particular service (again, such as tcp/22), but have this access
    granted  via a random translated port.  That is, once the *fwknop*
    client has been executed in this mode and the random port selected
    by *fwknop* is displayed, the destination port used by the follow-on
    client must be changed to match this random port.  For 'SSH', this is
    accomplished via the *-p* argument.  See the *--nat-local* and
    *--nat-access* command line arguments to *fwknop* for additional
    details on gaining access to services via a NAT operation.

*-p, --server-port*='<port>'::
    Specify the port number where *fwknopd* accepts packets via libpcap or
    ulogd pcap writer.  By default *fwknopd* looks for authorization packets
    over UDP port 62201.

*-P, --server-proto*='<protocol>'::
    Set the protocol (udp, tcp, http, udpraw, tcpraw, or icmp) for the outgoing
    SPA packet.  Note: The *udpraw*, *tcpraw*, and *icmp* modes use raw sockets
    and thus require root access to run.  Also note: The *tcp* mode expects to
    establish a TCP connection to the server before sending the SPA packet.
    This is not normally done, but is useful for compatibility with the Tor for
    strong anonymity; see 'http://tor.eff.org/'.  In this case, the
    *fwknopd* server will need to be configured to listen on the target TCP
    port (which is 62201 by default).

*-Q, --spoof-src*='<IP>'::
    Spoof the source address from which the *fwknop* client sends SPA
    packets.  This requires root on the client side access since a raw
    socket is required to accomplish this.  Note that the *--spoof-user*
    argument can be given in this mode in order to pass any *REQUIRE_USERNAME*
    keyword that might be specified in '@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access.conf'.

*-r, --rand-port*::
    Instruct the *fwknop* client to send an SPA packet over a random
    destination port between 10,000 and 65535.  The *fwknopd* server must
    use a *PCAP_FILTER* variable that is configured to accept such packets.
    For example, the *PCAP_FILTER* variable could be set to: ``+udp dst
    portrange 10000-65535+''.

*-R, --resolve-ip-http*::
    This is an important option, and instructs the *fwknop* client and
    the *fwknopd* daemon/service to query a web server that returns the
    caller's IP address (as seen by the web server). In some cases, this is
    needed to determine the IP address that should be allowed through the
    iptables policy at the remote fwknopd server side.  This is useful if
    the *fwknop* client is being used on a system that is behind an obscure
    NAT address. Presently, *fwknop* uses the URL:
    'http://www.cipherdyne.org/cgi-bin/myip' to resolve the caller IP.  Note
    that it is generally more secure to use the *-a* option if the externally
    routable IP address for the client is already known to the user since this
    elminates the need for *fwknop* to issue an HTTP request.

*--resolve-url* '<url>'::
    Override the default URL used for resolving the source IP address. For
    best results, the URL specified here should point to a web service that
    provides just an IP address in the body of the HTTP response.

*-s, --source-ip*::
    Instruct the *fwknop* client to form an SPA packet that contains the
    special-case IP address ``+0.0.0.0+'' which will inform the destination
    *fwknopd* SPA server to use the source IP address from which the
    SPA packet originates as the IP that will be allowed through upon
    modification of the firewall ruleset.  This option is useful if the
    *fwknop* client is deployed on a machine that is behind a NAT device and
    the external IP is not known.  However, usage of this option is not
    recommended, and either the *-a* or *-R* options should be used instead.
    The permit-address options *-s*, *-R* and *-a* are mutually
    exclusive.

*-S, --source-port*='<port>'::
    Set the source port for outgoing SPA packet.

*-f, --fw-timeout*='<seconds>'::
    Specify the length of time (seconds) that the remote firewall rule that
    grants access to a service is to remain active.  The default maintained by
    *fwknopd* is 30 seconds, but any established connection can be kept open
    after the initial accept rule is deleted through the use of a connection
    tracking mechanism that may be offered by the firewall.

*-C, --server-cmd*='<command to execute>'::
    Instead of requesting access to a service with an SPA packet, the
    *--server-cmd* argument specifies a command that will be executed by
    the *fwknopd* server.  The command is encrypted within the SPA packet
    and sniffed off the wire (as usual) by the *fwknopd* server.

*-H, --http-proxy*='<proxy-host>[:port]'::
    Specify an HTTP proxy that the *fwknop* client will use to send the SPA
    packet through.  Using this option will automatically set the SPA packet
    transmission mode (usually set via the *--server-proto* argument) to
    "http".  You can also specify the proxy port by adding ":<port>" to
    the proxy host name or ip.

*-m, --digest-type*='<digest>'::
    Specify the message digest algorithm to use in the SPA data.  Choices
    are: *MD5*, *SHA1*, *SHA256* (the default), *SHA384*, and *SHA512*.

*-M, --encryption-mode*='<mode>'::
    Specify the encryption mode when AES is used for encrypting SPA packets.
    The default is CBC mode, but others can be chosen such as CFB or OFB
    as long as this is also specified in the '@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access.conf' file on the
    server side via the ENCRYPTION_MODE variable.  In general, it is
    recommended to not include this argument and let the default (CBC) apply.
    Note that the string ``legacy'' can be specified in order to generate SPA
    packets with the old initialization vector strategy used by versions of
    *fwknop* prior to 2.5.  With the 2.5 release, *fwknop* generates
    initialization vectors in a manner that is compatible with OpenSSL via the
    PBKDF1 algorithm.

*--time-offset-plus*='<time>'::
    By default, the *fwknopd* daemon on the server side enforces time
    synchronization between the clocks running on client and server
    systems.  The *fwknop* client places the local time within each SPA
    packet as a time stamp to be validated by the fwknopd server after
    decryption.  However, in some circumstances, if the clocks are out
    of sync and the user on the client system does not have the required
    access to change the local clock setting, it can be difficult to
    construct and SPA packet with a time stamp the server will accept. 
    In this situation, the *--time-offset-plus* option can allow the user
    to specify an offset (e.g. ``60sec'' ``60min'' ``2days'' etc.) that is
    added to the local time.

*--time-offset-minus*='<time>'::
    This is similar to the *--time-offset-plus* option (see above), but
    subtracts the specified time offset instead of adding it to the local
    time stamp.

*-u, --user-agent*='<user-agent-string>'::
    Set the HTTP User-Agent for resolving the external IP via *-R*, or for
    sending SPA packets over HTTP.

*-U, --spoof-user*='<user>'::
    Specify the username that is included within SPA packet.  This allows
    the *fwknop* client to satisfy any non-root *REQUIRE_USERNAME* keyword
    on the fwknopd server (*--spoof-src* mode requires that the *fwknop*
    client is executed as root).

*--icmp-type*='<type>'::
    In *-P icmp* mode, specify the ICMP type value that will be set in the
    SPA packet ICMP header.  The default is echo reply.

*--icmp-code*='<code>'::
    In *-P icmp* mode, specify the ICMP code value that will be set in the
    SPA packet ICMP header.  The default is zero.


GPG OPTIONS
-----------
Note that the usage of GPG for SPA encryption/decryption can and should involve
GPG keys that are signed by each side (client and server).  The basic procedure
for this involves the following steps after the client key has been transferred
to the server and vice-versa:

..........................
    [spaserver]# gpg --import client.asc
    [spaserver]# gpg --edit-key 1234ABCD
    Command> sign

*--gpg-agent*::
    Instruct *fwknop* to acquire GnuPG key password from a running gpg-agent
    instance (if available).

*--gpg-home-dir*='<dir>'::
    Specify the path to the GnuPG directory; normally this path is derived
    from the home directory of the user that is running the *fwknop*
    client (so the default is '~/.gnupg').  This is useful when a ``root''
    user wishes to log into a remote machine whose sshd daemon/service does not
    permit root login.

*--gpg-recipient*='<key ID or Name>'::
    Specify the GnuPG key ID, e.g. ``+1234ABCD+'' (see the output of
    "gpg--list-keys") or the key name (associated email address) of the
    recipient of the Single Packet Authorization message.  This key is
    imported by the *fwknopd* server and the associated private key is used
    to decrypt the SPA packet.  The recipient’s key must first be imported
    into the client GnuPG key ring.

*--gpg-signer-key*='<key ID or Name>'::
    Specify the GnuPG key ID, e.g. ``+ABCD1234+'' (see the output of
    "gpg --list-keys") or the key name to use when signing the SPA message. 
    The user is prompted for the associated GnuPG password to create the
    signature.  This adds a cryptographically strong mechanism to allow
    the *fwknopd* daemon on the remote server to authenticate who created
    the SPA message.

*--gpg-no-signing-pw*::
    Instruct *fwknop* to not acquire a passphrase for usage of GnuPG signing
    key.  This option is provided to make SPA packet construction easier for
    client-side operations in automated environments where the passphrase for
    the signing key has been removed from the GnuPG key ring.  However, it is
    usually better to leverage 'gpg-agent' instead of using this option.

FWKNOPRC FILE
-------------
The '.fwknoprc' file is used to set various parameters to override default
program parameters at runtime.  It also allows for additional named
configuration 'stanzas' for setting program parameters for a particular
invocation.

The *fwknop* client will create this file if it does not exist in the user's
home directory.  This initial version has some sample directives that are
commented out.  It is up to the user to edit this file to meet their needs.

The '.fwknoprc' file contains a default configuration area or stanza which
holds global configuration directives that override the program defaults. 
You can edit this file and create additional 'named stanzas' that can be
specified with the *-n* or *--named-config* option. Parameters defined in
the named stanzas will override any matching 'default' stanza directives.
Note that command-line options will still override any corresponding
'.fwknoprc' directives.

There are directives to match most of the command-line parameters *fwknop*
supports.  Here is the current list of each directive along with a brief
description and its matching command-line option(s):

*SPA_SERVER* '<hostname/IP-address>'::
    Specify the hostname or IP of the destination (*fwknopd*) server
    ('-D, --destination').

*ALLOW_IP* '<IP-address>'::
    Specify the address to allow within the SPA data.  Note: This parameter
    covers the *-a*, *-s*, and *-R* command-line options.  You can specify
    a hostname or IP address (the *-a* option), specify the word "source" to
    tell the *fwknopd* server to accept the source IP of the packet as the IP
    to allow (the *-s* option), or use the word "resolve" to have *fwknop*
    resolve the external network IP via HTTP request (the *-R* option).

*ACCESS* '<port list>'::
    Set the one or more protocol/ports to open on the firewall ('-A, --access').
    The format of this list is ``+<proto>/<port>...<proto>/<port>+'', e.g. ``tcp/22,udp/53''.

*SPA_SERVER_PORT* '<port>'::
    Set the server port to use for sending the SPA packet ('-p, --server-port').

*SPA_SERVER_PROTO* '<protocol'>::
    Set the protocol to use for sending the SPA packet ('-P, --server-proto').

*KEY* '<passphrase>'::
    This is the passphrase that is used for SPA packet encryption and applies
    to both Rijndael or GPG encryption modes.  The actual encryption key that
    is used for Rijndael is derived from the PBKDF1 algorithm, and the GPG key
    is derived from the specified GPG key ring.

*KEY_BASE64* '<base64 encoded passphrase>'::
    Specify the encryption passphrase as a base64 encoded string.  This allows
    non-ascii characters to be included in the base64-decoded key.

*USE_HMAC* '<Y/N>'::
    Set HMAC mode for authenticated encryption of SPA packets.  This will have
    *fwknop* prompt the user for a dedicated HMAC key that is independent of
    the encryption key.  Alternatively, the HMAC key can be specified with the
    'HMAC_KEY' or 'HMAC_KEY_BASE64' directives (see below).

*HMAC_KEY* '<key>'::
    Specify the HMAC key for authenticated encryption of SPA packets.  This
    supports both Rijndael and GPG encryption modes, and is applied according
    to the encrypt-then-authenticate model.

*HMAC_KEY_BASE64* '<base64 encoded key>'::
    Specify the HMAC key as a base64 encoded string.  This allows non-ascii
    characters to be included in the base64-decoded key.

*HMAC_DIGEST_TYPE* '<digest algorithm>'::
    Set the HMAC digest algorithm used for authenticated encryption of SPA
    packets.  Choices are: *MD5*, *SHA1*, *SHA256* (the default), *SHA384*,
    and *SHA512*.

*SPA_SOURCE_PORT* '<port>'::
    Set the source port to use for sending the SPA packet ('-S, --source-port').

*FW_TIMEOUT* '<seconds>'::
    Set the firewall rule timeout value ('-f, --fw-timeout').

*RESOLVE_URL* '<url>'::
    Set to a URL that will be used for resolving the source IP address
    (--resolve-url).

*TIME_OFFSET* '<time>'::
    Set a value to apply to the timestamp in the SPA packet.  This can
    be either a positive or negative value ('--time-offset-plus/minus').

*ENCRYPTION_MODE* '<mode>'::
    Specify the encryption mode when AES is used.  This variable is a synonym
    for the '-M, --encryption-mode' command line argument.  In general, it is
    recommended to not include this argument and let the default (CBC) apply.
    Note that the string ``legacy'' can be specified in order to generate SPA
    packets with the old initialization vector strategy used by versions of
    *fwknop* prior to 2.5.

*DIGEST_TYPE* '<digest algorithm>'::
    Set the SPA message digest type ('-m, --digest-type').  Choices are: *MD5*,
    *SHA1*, *SHA256* (the default), *SHA384*, and *SHA512*.

*USE_GPG* '<Y/N>'::
    Set to 'Y' to specify the use of GPG for encryption ('--gpg-encryption').

*USE_GPG_AGENT* '<Y/N>'::
    Set to 'Y' to have *fwknop* interface with a GPG agent instance for the GPG
    key password ('--gpg-agent').  Agent information itself is specified with
    the 'GPG_AGENT_INFO' environmental variable.

*GPG_SIGNING_PW* '<passphrase>'::
    This is the passphrase that is used for signing SPA packet data in GPG
    encryption mode, and is a synonym for the 'KEY' variable (i.e. the signing
    passphrase can be specified with the 'KEY' variable instead).  The SPA
    packet is encrypted with the remote server key and signed with the local
    client key.

*GPG_SIGNING_PW_BASE64* '<base64 encoded passphrase>'::
    Specify the GPG signing passphrase as a base64 encoded string.  This allows
    non-ascii characters to be included in the base64-decoded key.

*GPG_SIGNER* '<key ID or Name>'::
    Specify the GPG key name or ID for signing the GPG-encrypted SPA data
    ('--gpg-signer-key').

*GPG_RECIPIENT* '<key ID or Name>'::
    Specify the GPG key name or ID for the recipient of the GPG-encrypted SPA
    data ('--gpg-recipient-key').

*GPG_HOMEDIR* '<dir>'::
    Specify the GPG home directory ('--gpg-home-dir').  Defaults to '~/.gnupg'.

*SPOOF_USER* '<user>'::
    Set the username in the SPA data to the specified value ('-U,
    --spoof-user').

*SPOOF_SOURCE_IP* '<IP>'::
    Set the source IP of the outgoing SPA packet to the specified value
    ('-Q, --spoof-source').

*RAND_PORT* '<Y/N>'::
    Send the SPA packet over a randomly assigned port ('-r, --rand-port').

*KEY_FILE* '<file>'::
    Load an encryption key/password from a file ('-G, --get-key').

*HTTP_USER_AGENT* '<agent string>'::
    Set the HTTP User-Agent for resolving the external IP via -R, or for
    sending SPA packets over HTTP ('-u, --user-agent').

*NAT_ACCESS* '<internalIP:forwardPort>'::
    Gain NAT access to an internal service protected by the fwknop server
    ('-N, --nat-access').

*NAT_LOCAL* '<Y/N>'::
    Access a local service via a forwarded port on the fwknopd server
    system ('--nat-local').

*NAT_PORT* '<port>'::
    Specify the port to forward to access a service via NAT ('--nat-port').

*NAT_RAND_PORT* '<Y/N>'::
    Have the fwknop client assign a random port for NAT access
    ('--nat-rand-port').


ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*SPOOF_USER*, *GPG_AGENT_INFO* (only used in *--gpg-agent* mode).

SPA PACKET SPOOFING
-------------------
Because *fwknop* places the IP to be allowed through the firewall within the
encrypted SPA payload (unless *-s* is used which is not recommended and can be
prohibited in the *fwknopd* server configuration), SPA packets can easily be
spoofed, and this is a good thing in this context.  That is, the source IP of
an SPA packet is ignored by the *fwknopd* daemon (when the 'REQUIRE_SOURCE_ADDRESS'
variable is set in the '@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access.conf' file) and only the IP that is
contained within an authenticated and properly decrypted SPA packet is granted
access through the firewall.  This makes it possible to make it appear as
though, say, www.yahoo.com is trying to authenticate to a target system but in
reality the actual connection will come from a seemingly unrelated IP.


EXAMPLES
--------
The following examples illustrate the command line arguments that could
be supplied to the fwknop client in a few situations:

Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~
The most effective and easiest way to use *fwknop* is to have the client
generate both an encryption key and an HMAC key, and then save them to the
``$HOME/.fwknoprc'' file along with access request specifics.  The keys will
also need to be transferred to the system where *fwknopd* is running.  The
also client supports a separate set of encryption and HMAC keys for each SPA
destination if multiple fwknopd servers are running on different systems.

So, assuming that the IP '2.2.2.2' is the system where *fwknopd* is deployed
and SSH is protected by the firewall on that system in a default-drop stance,
run the client like so to generate encryption and HMAC keys:

..........................
    $ fwknop -A tcp/22 --use-hmac -R -D 2.2.2.2 --key-gen --save-rc-stanza --verbose
    [+] Wrote Rijndael and HMAC keys to rc file: /home/user/.fwknoprc
..........................

With the access request arguments and encryption and HMAC keys generated and saved
in ``$HOME/.fwknoprc'', the keys themselves need to be transferred to the '2.2.2.2'
system where fwknopd is running.  As always, this should be done via some secure
means such as SSH before SPA is enabled and SSHD is blocked by the firewall.  Here
is what the new '2.2.2.2' stanza looks like in the '~/.fwknoprc' file:

..........................
    $ tail -n 8 /home/user/.fwknoprc
    [2.2.2.2]
    ACCESS                      tcp/22
    SPA_SERVER                  2.2.2.2
    KEY_BASE64                  HvUtIOramehLGKimD4ECXOzinaH4h3U8H1WXum7b54Q=
    HMAC_KEY_BASE64             DLeLf93a3yBT2vhEpM+dWlirGta5GU+jdyG5uXp4461HgOtbqMem4gX0Bp2PJGzYZlbbcavcOM00UPm+0GqkXA==
    USE_HMAC                    Y
    VERBOSE                     Y
    RESOLVE_IP_HTTP             Y
..........................

The keys are base64 encoded blobs of random data, and both the *KEY_BASE64* and
*HMAC_KEY_BASE64* lines should be copied verbatim and placed within the
'@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access.conf' file on '2.2.2.2'.  Once this is done, *fwknopd*
can be started on that system, a default-drop policy against SSH connections can
be put in place, and then access to SSH is managed via fwknop.  To access SSH,
just use the *-n* argument to reference the '2.2.2.2' stanza out of the .fwknoprc
file (some *--verbose* output is included for illustration):

..........................
    $ fwknop -n 2.2.2.2

Access mode examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most common usage of *fwknop* is to gain access to SSH running on a
remote system that has the *fwknopd* daemon deployed along with a default-drop
firewall policy.  The following command illustrates this where IP '1.1.1.1' is
the IP to be allowed through the firewall running on '3.3.3.3' (note that the
'@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access.conf' file consumed by *fwknopd* will need to have matching encryption
and HMAC keys, and configuration specifics can be found in the 'fwknopd(8)'
manual page).  Also, note the examples below prompt the user to supply the
encryption and HMAC keys via stdin instead of writing them to disk as in the
case of using the ``$HOME/.fwknoprc'' file in the example above.  However, all
of the following examples can be converted to using the ~/.fwknoprc file just by
adding the *--save-rc-stanza* argument:

..........................
    $ fwknop -A tcp/22 --use-hmac -a 1.1.1.1 -D 3.3.3.3
    Enter encryption key:
    Enter HMAC key:
    $ ssh -l user 3.3.3.3
    user@3.3.3.3's password:
..........................

If the *--verbose* flag is added to the command line, then some SPA packet
specifics are printed to stdout (not all output is shown for brevity):

..........................
    $ fwknop -A tcp/22 --use-hmac -a 1.1.1.1 -D 3.3.3.3 --verbose
    Enter encryption key:
    Enter HMAC key:

       Random Value: 1916307060193417
           Username: mbr
          Timestamp: 1368498909
        FKO Version: 2.5
       Message Type: 1 (Access msg)
     Message String: 1.1.1.1,tcp/22
         Nat Access: <NULL>
        Server Auth: <NULL>
     Client Timeout: 0 (seconds)
        Digest Type: 3 (SHA256)
          HMAC Type: 3 (SHA256)
    Encryption Type: 1 (Rijndael)
    Encryption Mode: 2 (CBC)
..........................

Simultaneous access to multiple services is also supported, and here is an
example of requesting access to both 'SSH' and 'OpenVPN' on '3.3.3.3':

..........................
    $ fwknop -A "tcp/22,tcp/1194" --use-hmac -a 1.1.1.1 -D 3.3.3.3
..........................

There are many cases where an *fwknop* client is deployed on a network behind
a NAT device and the externally routable IP is not known to the user.  In this
case, use the IP resolution service available at
'http://www.cipherdyne.org/cgi-bin/myip' via the *-R* command line switch in
order to derive the external client IP address.  This is a safer method of
acquiring the client IP address than using the *-s* option mentioned earlier
in this manual page because the source IP is put within the encrypted packet
instead of having the *fwknopd* daemon grant the requested access from whatever
IP address the SPA packet originates (i.e. using *-s* opens the possibility of
a MITM attack):

..........................
    $ fwknop -A tcp/22 --use-hmac -R -D 3.3.3.3
..........................

Use the Single Packet Authorization mode to gain access to 'SSH' and this time
use GnuPG keys to encrypt and decrypt:

..........................
    $ fwknop -A tcp/22 --use-hmac --gpg-sign ABCD1234 --gpg--recipient 1234ABCD -R -D 3.3.3.3
..........................

Instruct the fwknop server running at 3.3.3.3 to allow 1.1.1.1 to connect to
'SSH', but spoof the authorization packet from an IP associated with
'www.yahoo.com' (requires root on the *fwknop* client OS):

..........................
    # fwknop --spoof-src "www.yahoo.com" -A tcp/22 --use-hmac -a 1.1.1.1 -D 3.3.3.3
..........................

When *fwknopd* is running on an iptables firewall with systems deployed behind
it, it is possible to take advantage of the NAT capabilities offered by
iptables in order to transparently reach systems behind the firewall via SPA.
Here is an example where the *fwknop* client is used to gain access to SSH
running on the non-routable IP '192.168.10.23' that is deployed on the network
behind '3.3.3.3'.  In this case, the SSH connection made to '3.3.3.3' is
translated via NAT to the '192.168.10.2' system automatically:

..........................
    $ fwknop -A tcp/22 -N 192.168.10.2:22 -R -D 3.3.3.3
..........................


BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
-----------------------
With the '2.5' release, *fwknop* underwent significant changes in its usage of
cryptography including the addition of support for HMAC authenticated encryption
for both Rijndael and GnuPG modes, ensuring the proper usage of PBKDF1 for key
derivation when SPA packets are encrypted with Rijndael, and several bugs were
fixed from previous versions of fwknop.  In general, this implies that when
Rijndael is used, SPA packets produced by the '2.5' release are incompatible
with previous versions of fwknop.  The GnuPG encryption mode is unaffected by
these updates.  However, even with Rijndael is used, backwards compatibility is
supported through setting the 'legacy' encryption mode with
*-M* on the fwknop client command line and/or the 'ENCRYPTION_MODE' variable in
the '@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access.conf' file.  This way, a pre-2.5 server can
decrypt SPA packets produced by a 2.5 and later client (set '-M legacy'), and
a 2.5 and later server can decrypt SPA packets produced by pre-2.5 clients (set
'ENCRYPTION_MODE legacy' in the access.conf file).  Note that HMAC is only
supported as of 2.5 and is an optional feature, so backwards compatibility is
only for configurations that don't use an HMAC on either side.  It is strongly
recommended to upgrade all fwknop clients and servers to 2.5 and use the new
HMAC mode for properly authenticated SPA communications.  The backwards
compatibility support is used to make it easier to upgrade clients and servers
with a phased approach.

For emphasis, if the *fwknopd* server is upgraded to 2.5 (or later), but older
clients cannot be upgraded at the same time, then for each 'SOURCE' stanza in
the '@sysconfdir@/fwknop/access.conf' file, add the following line:

..........................
    ENCRYPTION_MODE         legacy
..........................

In addition, if the 'KEY' variable has an encryption key longer than 16 bytes,
it will need to be truncated to 16 characters in the 'access.conf' file in
order for pre-2.5 clients to work properly.  This limitation is fixed in 2.5,
and provides additional motiviation for upgrading all clients and servers to
2.5 or later.

Now, flipping the scenario around, if the *fwknop* clients are upgraded but the
*fwknopd* server is still at a pre-2.5 version, then add the '-M legacy'
argument to the fwknop command line:

..........................
    $ fwknop -A tcp/22 -M legacy -R -D 2.2.2.2
..........................


DEPENDENCIES
------------
The *fwknop* client requires 'libfko' which is normally included with both source
and binary distributions, and is a dedicated library developed by the fwknop
project.  Whenever the *fwknopd* server is used, 'libpcap' is a required dependency.
However, the upcoming '2.6' release will offer a UDP listener mode along with
privilege separation support and will not require libpcap in this mode.  In UDP
listener mode, even though fwknopd binds to a UDP port, SPA packets are never
acknowledged so from an attacker's perspective there is no difference between
fwknopd sniffing the wire passively vs. listening on a UDP socket in terms of
what can be scanned for.

For GPG functionality, GnuPG must also be correctly installed and configured
along with the 'libgpgme' library.

To take advantage of all of the authentication and access management
features of the *fwknopd* daemon/service a functioning 'iptables', 'ipfw', or 'pf'
firewall is required on the underlying operating system.


DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
The most comprehensive way to gain diagnostic information on *fwknop* is to run
the test suite 'test-fwknop.pl' script located in the 'test/' directory in the fwknop
sources.  The test suite sends fwknop through a large number of run time
tests, has 'valgrind' support, validates both SPA encryption and HMAC results
against OpenSSL, and even has its own built in fuzzer for SPA communications.
For more basic diagnostic information, *fwknop* can be executed with the *-T*
(or *--test*) command line option.  This will have *fwknop* simply create and
print the SPA packet information, then run it through a decrypt/decode cycle
and print it again.  In addition, the *--verbose* command line switch is useful
to see various SPA packet specifics printed to stdout.
