1 Introduction
**************

The "Firewall Knock Operator Library" (libfko) is a C language library
that implements the functions needed to create and/or parse "Single
Packet Authorization" (SPA) data.  It is designed to abstract the
details of encoding, encryption, decoding, parsing, and verifying SPA
messages such as those used by Michael Rash's "Firewall Knock Operator"
(fwknop).

   "fwknop" implements SPA; an authorization scheme that requires only
a single encrypted packet to communicate various pieces of information
including desired access through an iptables policy and/or specific
commands to execute on the target system.  The main application for a
program of this type is to protect services such as SSH with an
additional layer of security in order to make the exploitation of
vulnerabilities much more difficult.

   libfko is not an implementation of an fwknop client or server.  It
simply provides the functions for managing the SPA data used by those
programs.

`http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop'.

1.1 Getting Started
===================

This manual documents the "Firewall Knock Operator" library programming
interface.  All functions and data types provided by the library are
explained.

   This manual can be used in a couple of ways.  If read from the
beginning to the end, it should give a good introduction into the
library and how it can be used in an application.  Later on, the manual
can be used as a reference manual to get just the information needed
about any particular interface of the library.


File: libfko.info,  Node: Features,  Next: Overview,  Prev: Getting Started,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Features
============

The primary advantage of using libfko is it provides a single API for
either creating, or parsing of existing SPA data that is fully
compatible with the existing Perl-based fwknop implemetation.  Other
advantages include:

It's free software
     Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of
     the GNU General Public License (*note Library Copying::).

It's lightweight
     The Perl-based implementation requires several additional Perl
     modules and has a relatively large footprint in memory.  This
     C-based library eliminates those dependencies and has a much
     smaller footprint.

It's easy
     libfko hides many of the gory details of fwknop's SPA message data
     format, encoding, encrypting, decrypting, decoding, and parsing.
     In most cases, only a few function calls will be needed create or
     parse a SPA message.

1.3 Overview
============

* Menu:

* SPA Data Format::               Description of the SPA data
                                  format.

   libfko functionality can be divided into two roles.  One is the
creation of an encrypted SPA message.  The other is the taking an
encrypted SPA message to decode, parse, and extract the original data.

   The actual SPA data handling and operations are set within a
context.  The context represents a single SPA message and provides
configuration parameters and data settings for defining that message.
All operations on the data occur within that context.

   Some operations on the context must occur before others.  Details of
these dependencies are covered in *note Creating a SPA Message::.

With libfko, working with SPA message data basically consists of the
following steps in order:

   * Create a new context

   * Work with (get/set) the SPA data fields

   * Destroy the context


File: libfko.info,  Node: SPA Data Format,  Up: Overview

1.3.1 SPA Data Format
---------------------

The format of the SPA message data used by fwknop (before encryption)
is a colon-delimited string containing the individual SPA data fields.
Some of these fields are base64-encoded in the final encoding process
as dictated by the current fwknop implementation.

 -- Variable: data spa_message_fields
     Using the libfko names for the data fields, the list of these
     fields (in order) follows:
    `*rand_value* - _Default: Random (created upon context creation)_'
          A 16-byte random numeric string.

    `*username* - _Default: Current login user or Value of `SPOOF_USER' env var_'
          The base64-encoded username associated with this SPA data.

    `*timestamp* - _Default: The Unix time at creation_'
          The Unix timestamp value.

    `*version* - _Default: the current fwknop version_'
          The current fwknop version that supports this format.  This
          field is not user settable.

    `*spa_message_type* - _Default: SPA access message (`FKO_ACCESS_MSG')_'
          The SPA message type value for this message.

    `*spa_message*'
          The base64-encoded SPA message itself (an access request or
          command string).

    `*spa_nat_access*'
          An optional base64-encoded request for NAT access.

    `*spa_server_auth*'
          An optional base64-encoded string that can  be used as an
          additional authentication mechanism at the fwknop server.

    `*spa_client_timeout*'
          An optional client timeout value that can be supplied to the
          fwknop server.

    `*spa_digest* - _Computed value_'
          The digest of the previous fields (including the delimiters).

   With all fields defined, a complete (unencoded) SPA message would
look something like the following example (Note: The line is broken for
readability and the username, message, nat_access, and server_auth
fields are not base64-encoded):


     8307540982176539:juser:1230665172:1.1.10:1:0.0.0.0,tcp/22:192.168.1.2,22:
     crypt,mypw:120:xswj8V0zMR7/7MV9pQRarSKWG1l9Zfjv+kbXaKrJ+RA


   For most of the fields, you need not be too concerned about the
format as libfko handles that.  The exceptions are the `spa_message',
`spa_nat_access', and `spa_server_auth'.  The formats for these are not
handled by libfko during creation.  However, they are checked for
format validity during the endcoding and decoding (when parsing
incoming) SPA data.  More information on the specifics of the formats
for these fields can be found in *note SPA Messages::.

your programs.

File: libfko.info,  Node: libfko Header,  Next: Compiling with libfko,  Up: Preparation

2.1 libfko Header
=================

All interfaces (data types and functions) of the library are defined in
the header file `fko.h'.  You must include this in all programs using
the library, either directly or through some other header file, like
this:

     #include <fko.h>

   The name space of FKO is `fko_*' for function names and data types
and `FKO_*' for other symbols. Other symbols internal to FKO may take
the form `_fko_*' and `_FKO_*'.


File: libfko.info,  Node: Compiling with libfko,  Next: SPA Parameter Types,  Prev: libfko Header,  Up: Preparation

2.2 Compiling with libfko
=========================

If you want to compile a source file including the `fko.h' header file,
you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the directory
hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the directory in
which the header file is located to the compilers include file search
path (via the `-I' option).

   For example, if you installed libfko in `/opt/fko', you may want to
add `-I/opt/fko/include' to `CFLAGS', or directly on the command-line:

     gcc -c foo.c -I/opt/fko/include ...

   The same is true when linking a program with the library.  In this
case, the linker has to find the library files.  For this to work, the
path to the library files has to be added to the library search path
(via the `-L' option).

   Continuing with the example above you may want to add
`-L/opt/fko/lib' to `LDFLAGS', or directly on the command-line:

     gcc -o foo foo.c -I/opt/fko/include -L/opt/fko/lib -lfko

* Encryption Algorithms::         Encryption schemes supported by libfko


File: libfko.info,  Node: Digests,  Next: SPA Messages,  Up: SPA Parameter Types

2.3.1 Digests
-------------

The fwknop system employs a message digest hash of the SPA data as one
of the data fields to act a signature which can be used at the
receiving end to verify the data is valid.  This provides a means to
ensure the data was not modified in-transit.  The resulting digest is
base64-encoded before it is added to the SPA data.

   Currently, libfko support the same message digests as the legacy
fwknop plus 2 others (SHA384 and SHA512).  These are (in order of
strength):

 -- Variable: int fko_digest_type_t
    `FKO_DIGEST_MD5'

    `FKO_DIGEST_SHA1'

    `FKO_DIGEST_SHA256  (libfko default)'

    `FKO_DIGEST_SHA384'

    `FKO_DIGEST_SHA512'

   As indicated in the list above, SHA256 is the default.  This means
the digest type does not need to be explicitly set unless you wish to
use one of the other values.  This applies to all libfko SPA data
fields that have a default value.

2.3.2 SPA Messages
------------------

The fwknop system (and subsequently libfko), support a specific set of
message types.  The message type value is used by fwknop to help
determine the correct message format and content.  These message types
are:

 -- Variable: int fko_message_type_t
    `FKO_COMMAND_MSG'
          A request to have the fwknop server execute the given
          command.  The format for this type is: `<ip of
          requestor>,<command text>'.
               "192.168.1.2,uname -a"

    `FKO_ACCESS_MSG'
          A basic access request.  This is the most common type in use.
          The format for this type is: `<ip of
          requestor>,<protocol>/<port>'.  Note that mulitple
          protocol/port entries are allowed.
               "192.168.1.2,tcp/22"
               "192.168.1.2,tcp/22,udp/5005"

    `FKO_NAT_ACCESS_MSG'
          An access request that also provide information for the
          fwknop server to create a Network Address Translation (NAT to
          an internal address. The format for this string is:
          `<internal ip>,<ext nat port>'.
               "10.10.1.2,9922"

    `FKO_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_ACCESS_MSG'
          This is an FKO_ACCESS_REQUEST with a timeout parameter for
          the fwknop server.  The timeout value is provided via the
          `client_timeout' data field.

    `FKO_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_NAT_ACCESS_MSG'
          This is an FKO_NAT_ACCESS_REQUEST with a timeout parameter
          for the fwknop server.  The timeout value is provided via the
          `client_timeout' data field.

    `FKO_LOCAL_NAT_ACCESS_MSG'
          This is similar to the FKO_NAT_ACCESS request exept the NAT is
          to the local to the server (i.e. a service listening on
          127.0.0.1).

    `FKO_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_LOCAL_NAT_ACCESS_MSG'
          This is an FKO_LOCAL_NAT_ACCESS_REQUEST with a timeout
          parameter for the fwknop server.  The timeout value is
          provided via the `client_timeout' data field.


File: libfko.info,  Node: Encryption Algorithms,  Prev: SPA Messages,  Up: SPA Parameter Types

2.3.3 Encryption Algorithms
---------------------------

One of the final steps in creating an fwknop SPA message is encrypting
the entire message.  Currently, fwknop supports two methods of
encryption:

 -- Variable: int fko_encryption_type_t
    `FKO_ENCRYPTION_RIJNDAEL (default)'

    `FKO_ENCRYPTION_GPG'

   As indicated, libfko uses Rijndael encryption by default.  Rijndael
encryption is sufficient for most users and produces a much smaller data
packet than GPG (between 140 bytes with MD5 digest to around 225 bytes
or so with SHA512, compared to around 1100 for signed GPG).

   However, some may prefer the higher level of security provided by
GPG.  When selected, additional parameters such as _recipient_ and
_signer_ may be set as well. See *note Setting SPA Data:: for detail on
setting these and other SPA data fields.

File: libfko.info,  Node: Creating Contexts,  Next: Destroying Contexts,  Up: Using libfko

3.1 Creating Contexts
=====================

Before doing anything with libfko, you need to create a context.  A
context is created for one of two reasons.  One is for the purpose of
building a new fko SPA message from scratch (typically to be packaged
and sent to an fwknop server somewhere). The other would be a context
for taking an existing SPA message for decoding, parsing, and data
extraction.

For building a new fko SPA message, you will use the `fko_new' function:

 -- Function: int fko_new (fko_ctx_t *CTX)
     The function `fko_new' sets up and initializes a new `fko_ctx_t'
     object, pre-populates default values and returns a handle for it
     in CTX.  The function returns the error code `FKO_SUCCESS' if the
     context was successfully created.  Otherwise an another error code
     will be returned (*note Error Handling:: for details on the
     various error codes and their meanings).

     fko_ctx_t   ctx;
     int         rc;

     rc = fko_new(&ctx);

     if(rc != FKO_SUCCESS)
     {
         fprintf(stderr, "Error %i from fko_new: %s\n",
             rc, fko_errstr(rc));
         exit(1);
     }

For a context that will be used for receiving and parsing an existing
SPA message, you will use the `fko_new_with_data' function:

 -- Function: int fko_new_with_data
          (fko_ctx_t *CTX, char *DATA, char *KEY)
     The function `fko_new_with_data' sets up and initializes a new
     `fko_ctx_t' context, but instead of initializing default values, it
     stores the encrypted message data and makes it ready for parsing.
     This can be done in one of two ways.  One is to pass `NULL' for
     the third argument.  The context will be created and the data will
     be stored, but no decryption or decoding takes place.  In this
     case, you will need to call `fko_decrypt_spa_data' at a later
     time.  The other way to do it is to supply the KEY value; which
     would be the password or decryption key.  In this case, the
     context is created, the SPA data is decrypted, decoded, parsed,
     and stored in the context ready for retrieval.

     The `fko_new_with_data' function returns the error code
     `FKO_SUCCESS' if the context was successfully created.  If any of
     the intermediate steps in parsing the data, validating the SPA
     message digest, or any other internal action fails, then the
     appropriate error code is returned.

The most common (simple) case...

     fko_ctx_t   ctx;
     char       *spa_data;
     char       *key;
     int rc;

     /* Assume we called code that retrieves the data and key
     */

     rc = fko_new_with_data(&ctx, spa_data, key);

     if(rc != FKO_SUCCESS)
     {
         fprintf(stderr, "Error %i from fko_new_with_data: %s\n",
             rc, fkoerrstr(rc));
         exit(1);
     }

Or, perhaps you need to defer decryption and parsing to a later point
in the program.  We could use fko_new_with_data(), passing NULL for the
decryption key, or we could use fko_new() to create an empty context,
then use fko_set_spa_data() to add the encypted data (see comments in
the code samples).

     fko_ctx_t   ctx;
     char       *spa_data;
     char       *key;
     int rc;

     /* Assume we called code that retrieves the data and key
     */

     rc = fko_new_with_data(&ctx, spa_data, NULL);

     if(rc != FKO_SUCCESS)
     {
         fprintf(stderr, "Error from fko_new_with_data: %s\n",
             fko_errstr(rc));
         exit(1);
     }

     /* We could also just create and empty context and add the
      * encrypted data as follows:
      *
      * rc = fko_new(&ctx);
      * ... check rc ...
      * rc = fko_set_spa_data(ctx, spa_data);
      * ...
     */

     /* Assume we called other code and functions...  */

     /* Decrypt and decode...
     */
     rc = fko_decrypt_spa_data(ctx, key);

     if(rc != FKO_SUCCESS)
     {
         fprintf(stderr, "Error from fko_decrypt_spa_data: %s\n",
             fko_errstr(rc));

3.2 Destroying Contexts
=======================

When you are done with the context, you must destroy it in order to
free up the memory and resources it was using.  This is especially
important in programs that process SPA data repeatedly (i.e. in a loop).
Failure to destroy the context can cause memory leaks in your program.

 -- Function: void fko_destroy (fko_ctx_t CTX)
     The function `fko_destroy' destroys the context with the handle
     CTX and releases all associated resources.

3.3 Creating a SPA Message
==========================

This section describes the process for creating a new fko SPA message.
After creating a context, there are still some requisite SPA data
fields and SPA parameters that need to be set before the final
encrypted message is ready.

   The following list contains the minimum required fields for a
complete fko SPA message.  You should also take note of the order of
these parameters as well.  Setting the "type" parameters first is
recommended (if you want a type other than the default).

   * digest_type - _(default may suffice)_

   * message_type - _(default may suffice)_

   * encryption_type - _(default may suffice)_

   * rand_val - _(default should suffice)_

   * time_stamp - _(default should suffice)_

   * username - _(default may suffice)_

   * spa_message - _(must be explicitly set)_

_If using gpg encryption:_

   * gpg_recipient - _(must be explicitly set)_

   * gpg_signer - _(optional, but recommended - must be explicitly set
     if used)_

   * gpg_home_dir - _(default may suffice - typically $HOME/.gnupg)_

   When a context is initialized, some of the SPA data fields are
pre-set with default values (*note SPA Data Format::).  For fields such
as `rand_val', `username', `timestamp', `message_type', and
`digest_type', these defaults may be sufficient.

   The functions used to set the various SPA data fields and parameters
are described in detail in *note Setting SPA Data::.

*Note*: Attempts to call any "`fko_'" function on a context that has
not been initialized can have undefined consequences.  Libfko will
attempt to recover, and if successful, will return a status of
`FKO_ERROR_CTX_NOT_INITIALIZED'.

   A common SPA message is a simple access request.  This request asks
the fwknop server to create a temporary firewall rule to allow a
particular IP address access to a particular port on the fwknop server.
Assuming the defaults are fine for this, all we need to do is create
the context, set the message data field, call the `fko_spa_data_final'
function to encode and encrypt, process the message, then destroy the
context.  Below, we have a contrived bit of code demonstrating this:

     int
     main(int argc, char **argv)
     {
         fko_ctx_t       ctx;        /* FKO Context */
         char           *password;   /* Encryption password */
         char           *final_spa;  /* Final encrypted SPA data */
         int             rc;         /* Result code */

         /*  Assume we processed the command line
          *  and retrieved the password.
         */

         /* Create the context */
         rc = fko_new(&ctx);
         if(rc != FKO_SUCCESS)
         {
             fprintf(stderr, "Error creating context: %s\n", fko_errstr(rc));
             exit(1);
         }

         /* Set the SPA message field - asking to open tcp port 22
          * for the system at 192.168.0.33
         */
         rc = fko_set_spa_message(ctx, "192.168.0.33,tcp/22");
         if(rc != FKO_SUCCESS)
         {
             fprintf(stderr, "Set SPA message failed: %s\n", fko_errstr(rc));
             exit(1);
         }

         /* Let us assume we are using GPG encryption.  So we need to
          * set the encryption type and set the required GPG parameters
          * (we can skip checking return values for brevity).
         */
         rc = fko_set_spa_encryption_type(ctx, FKO_ENCRYPTION_GPG);

         /* Key for the recipient */
         rc = fko_set_gpg_recipient(ctx, "recip@some.where");

         /* Key for the signer (if you want to sign it) */
         rc = fko_set_gpg_signer(ctx, "me@right.here");

         /* Finalize the SPA data */
         rc = fko_spa_data_final(ctx);
         if(rc != FKO_SUCCESS)
         {
             fprintf(stderr, "Error encoding SPA data: %s\n", fko_errstr(rc));
             exit(1);
         }

         /* Take the final message and do something with it */
         rc = fko_get_spa_data(ctx, &final_spa);

         /* Assume this function packs the spa data into a UDP
          * packet and sends it to the server.
         */
         send_spa_message(final_spa);

         /* Done with the context */
         fko_destroy(ctx);

         exit(0);
     }

3.4 Setting SPA Data
====================

This section describes the functions used for setting the various SPA
data fields and parameters.  All of these functions return an integer
representing the return status of the function. When succesfull, they
will return `FKO_SUCCESS'.  Otherwise, an error code value is returned.

 -- Function: int fko_set_spa_digest_type
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, short DIGEST_TYPE);
     Set the message digest type.  Valid values can be found in *note
     Digests:: of this manual. If a value other than the those that are
     supported is given, the function will return
     `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_DATA'.  For example:
              rc = fko_set_digest_type(ctx, FKO_DIGEST_SHA1);

 -- Function: int fko_set_spa_encryption_type
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, short ENCRYPT_TYPE);
     Set the encrytion algorithm to use when ecrypting the final SPA
     data. Valid values can be found in *note Encryption Algorithms::
     of this manual.  For example:
              rc = fko_set_encryption_type(ctx, FKO_ENCRYPTION_RIJNDAEL);

 -- Function: int fko_set_rand_value (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char *VAL);
     Set the random value portion of the spa data to the given value
     (VAL).  The given value must be a pointer to a 16-character
     decimal numeric string or NULL.  If the value is NULL, the
     function generate a new random value.  If a string value is
     provided, it must be a 16-character decimal string.  Otherwise,
     the function will return `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_DATA'.

 -- Function: int fko_set_username
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char *USERNAME);
     Set the username field of the SPA data. If USERNAME is NULL,
     libfko will first look for the environment variable `SPOOF_USER'
     and use its value if found.  Otherwise, it will try to determine
     the username itself using various methods starting with `cuser' or
     `getlogin', then fallback to the environment variables `LOGNAME'
     or `USER'. If none of those work, the function will return
     `FKO_ERROR_USERNAME_UNKNOWN'.

 -- Function: int fko_set_timestamp (fko_ctx_t CTX, int OFFSET);
     Sets the timestamp value of the SPA data to the current time plus
     the offset value.

 -- Function: int fko_set_spa_message_type
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, short MSG_TYPE);
     Sets the message type for the SPA data. The choices for the
     `spa_message_type' are listed in *note SPA Messages::.  For
     example:
              rc = fko_set_spa_message_type(ctx, FKO_ACCESS_MSG);

 -- Function: int fko_set_spa_message
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char *MSG_STRING);
     Set the SPA message string to the given value. If this string does
     not conform to the required `spa_nat_access' format, the function
     will return `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_DATA'.

 -- Function: int fko_set_spa_nat_access
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char *NAT_ACCESS);
     Set the optional SPA nat access string to the given value. If this
     string does not conform to the required `spa_nat_access' format,
     the function will return `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_DATA'.

 -- Function: int fko_set_spa_server_auth
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char *SERVER_AUTH);
     Set the optional (very seldom used) SPA server auth feature to the
     given value.  This parameter may become deprecated.

 -- Function: int fko_set_spa_client_timeout
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, int TIMEOUT);
     Sets the SPA client timeout value.  If the timeout is set to a
     value greater than 0, it is assumed the `spa_message_type' setting
     should be one of the "TIMEOUT" variants.  This function will
     change the `message_type' to the appropriate setting if necessary.
     However, it is recommended you set the correct `message_type'
     ahead of time.

 -- Function: int fko_set_spa_digest (fko_ctx_t CTX);
     Initiates a calculation (or recalculation) if the message digest
     hash for the current SPA data. If the required data fields are not
     set this function will return `FKO_ERROR_MISSING_ENCODED_DATA'.
     *Note*: It should not be necessary to call this function directly
     as it will be called automatically by other functions during normal
     processing (most notably `fko_spa_data_final').

 -- Function: int fko_set_spa_data (fko_ctx_t CTX, char *ENC_DATA);
     This function is used to place encrypted SPA data into a newly
     created empty context (i.e. with `fko_new'). In most cases, you
     would use `fko_new_with_data' so you wouldn't have to take the
     extra step to use this function.  However, some may find a reason
     to do it in this way.

_GPG-specific functions:_

 -- Function: int fko_set_gpg_recipient
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char RECIPIENT);
     Sets the GPG key for the recipient.  This would be the recipient's
     public key used to encyrpt the SPA data.  You can use the user name
     ("recip@the.dest.com") or the key ID ("5EXXXXCC").  At present,
     multiple recipients are not supported.

 -- Function: int fko_set_gpg_signer (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char SIGNER);
     Sets the GPG key for signing the data.  This would be the sender's
     key used to sign the SPA data. You can use the user name or key ID.

 -- Function: int fko_set_gpg_home_dir
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char HOME_DIR);
     Sets the GPG home directory for the current gpgme context.  This
     allows for using alternate keyrings, gpg configurations, etc.

 -- Function: int fko_set_gpg_signature_verify
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, unsigned char VERIFY);
     Sets the verify GPG signature flag.  When set to a true value, the
     GPG signature is extracted and checked for validity during the
     decryption/decoding phase.  When set to false, no attempt is made
     to access or check the signature.  This flag is set to true by
     default.

 -- Function: int fko_set_gpg_ignore_verify_error
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, unsigned char IGNORE);
     Sets the ignore signature verify error flag.  When set to a true
     value. Any signature verification errors are ignored (but still
     captured) and the decoding process will continue.  The default
     value of this flag is false.

 -- Function: int fko_set_gpg_exe (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char GPG_EXE);
     Sets the path to the GPG executable that _gpgme_ will use.  By
     default, _libfko_ forces _gpgme_ to use `gpg' in case _gpgme_ was
     compiled to use `gpg2' as its default engine.  You can use this
     function to override and set what GPG executable _gpgme_ will use.

*Note*: On a libfko build without GPG support, the GPG-related
functions above will simply return the FKO_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE
error code.

              rc = fko_get_spa_message_type(ctx, &msg_type);

              switch(msg_type)
              {
                  case FKO_ACCESS_MSG:
                      process_access_msg(...);
                      break;

     NAT_ACCESS is pointing to.  The return value is an FKO error
     status.

 -- Function: int fko_get_spa_server_auth
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, char **SERVER_AUTH);
     Assigns the pointer to the string holding the the fko SPA server
     auth message associated with the current context to the address

     Encryption Algorithms:: of this manual.  The return value is an
     FKO error status.

 -- Function: int fko_get_encoded_data (fko_ctx_t CTX, char **ENC_MSG);
     Assigns the pointer to the string holding the the encoded SPA data
     (before encryption) associated with the current context to the
     address ENC_MSG is pointing to.  This is intermediate data that
     would not normally be of use unless debugging the library. The
     return value is an FKO error status.

3.6 Utility Functions
=====================

This section describes the functions not covered elsewhere in this
manual.  These are utility functions that operate on the data in the fko
context.  All but `fko_spa_data_final' are called by other functions
and are not normally explictly called by the user.  However, they can
be, so they are listed here.

   All of these functions return an integer representing the return
status of the function. When succesfull, they will return `FKO_SUCCESS'.
Otherwise, an error code value is returned.

 -- Function: int fko_spa_data_final (fko_ctx_t CTX, char *ENC_KEY);
     This function is the final step in creating a complete encrypted
     SPA data string suitable for transmission to an fwknop server.  It
     does require all of the requisite SPA data fields be set,
     otherwise it will fail with an appropriate error code.

 -- Function: int fko_decrypt_spa_data (fko_ctx_t CTX, char *DEC_KEY);
     When given the correct KEY (password), this function decrypts,
     decodes, and parses the encrypted SPA data that was supplied to
     the context via the `fko_new_with_data' function that was also
     called without the KEY value.  Once the data is decrypted, this
     function will also call `fko_decode_spa_data' to decode, parse,
     validate, and store the data fields in the context for later
     retrieval.

 -- Function: int fko_encrypt_spa_data (fko_ctx_t CTX, char *ENC_KEY);
     Encrypts the intermediate encoded SPA data stored in the context.
     This function will call `fko_encode' if necessary.  It is normally
     not called directly as it is called from `fko_spa_data_final'.

 -- Function: int fko_decode_spa_data (fko_ctx_t CTX);
     This function performs the decoding, parsing, validation of the SPA
     data that was just decrypted. It is normally not called directly
     as it is called from `fko_decrypt_spa_data' (which is in turn
     called from `fko_new_with_data' if a password is supplied to it).

 -- Function: int fko_encode_spa_data (fko_ctx_t CTX);
     Performs the base64 encoding of those SPA data fields that need to
     be encoded, performs some data validation, and calls
     `fkp_set_spa_digest' to recompute the SPA message digest.  It is
     normally not called directly as it is called from
     `fko_encrypt_spa_data' (which is in turn called from
     `fko_spa_data_final').

_GPG-specific utility functions:_

 -- Function: int fko_gpg_signature_id_match
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char *ID, unsigned char *ID_MATCH);
     Sets the value of the ID_MATCH variable to true (1) if the value of
     ID matches the ID of the GPG signature associated with the current
     context. Otherwise, ID_MATCH is set to false (0). The return value
     is an FKO error status.

 -- Function: int fko_gpg_signature_fpr_match
          (fko_ctx_t CTX, const char *FPR, unsigned char *FPR_MATCH);
     Sets the value of the FPR_MATCH variable to true (1) if the value
     of FPR matches the fingerprint of the GPG signature associated
     with the current context. Otherwise, FPR_MATCH is set to false (0).
     The return value is an FKO error status.

3.7 Error Handling
==================

Most fko functions return an integer value that corresponds to either
success (0), or one of the non-zero values thar corresponds to a number
of possible errors.  libfko provides a function to get a descriptive
string for the given error code.

 -- Function: const char * fko_errstr (int ERR_CODE)
     The function `fko_errstr' returns a pointer to a statically
     allocated string containing the descripton of the error.

The list of the possible error codes and their corresponding
descriptions as returned by `fko_errstr' follows:

 -- Variable: int error_code
    `FKO_SUCCESS'
          Success

    `FKO_ERROR_CTX_NOT_INITIALIZED'
          FKO Context is not initialized

    `FKO_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION'
          Unable to allocate memory

    `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_DATA'
          Args contain invalid data

    `FKO_ERROR_DATA_TOO_LARGE'
          Value or Size of the data exceeded the max allowed

    `FKO_ERROR_USERNAME_UNKNOWN'
          Unable to determine username

    `FKO_ERROR_INCOMPLETE_SPA_DATA'
          Missing or incomplete SPA data

    `FKO_ERROR_MISSING_ENCODED_DATA'
          There is no encoded data to process

    `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_DIGEST_TYPE'
          Invalid digest type

    `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_ALLOW_IP'
          Invalid allow IP address in the SPA message data

    `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_SPA_COMMAND_MSG'
          Invalid SPA command message format

    `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_SPA_ACCESS_MSG'
          Invalid SPA access message format

    `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_SPA_NAT_ACCESS_MSG'
          Invalid SPA nat_access message format

    `FKO_ERROR_INVALID_ENCRYPTION_TYPE'
          Invalid encryption type

    `FKO_ERROR_WRONG_ENCRYPTION_TYPE'
          Wrong or inappropriate encryption type for this operation

    `FKO_ERROR_DECRYPTION_SIZE'
          Unexpected or invalid size for decrypted data

    `FKO_ERROR_DECRYPTION_FAILURE'
          Decryption failed or decrypted data is invalid

    `FKO_ERROR_DIGEST_VERIFICATION_FAILED'
          The computed digest did not match the digest in the spa data

    `FKO_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE'
          Unsupported or unimplemented feature or function

    `FKO_ERROR_UNKNOWN'
          Unknown/Unclassified error

   If GPG support is available, there are additional possible error
conditions and error codes.  The GPG support is implemented via GPGME.
The libfko error handling code wraps many of the GPGME error codes that
may be encountered while using libfko's GPG related functions.  These
are:

 -- Variable: int error_code (gpgme support only)
    `FKO_ERROR_MISSING_GPG_KEY_DATA'
          Missing GPG key data (signer or recipient not set)

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_NO_OPENPGP'
          This GPGME implementation does not support OpenPGP

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_CONTEXT'
          Unable to create GPGME context

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_PLAINTEXT_DATA_OBJ'
          Error creating the plaintext data object

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_SET_PROTOCOL'
          Unable to set GPGME to use OpenPGP protocol

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_CIPHER_DATA_OBJ'

          The GPG passphrase was not valid

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_ENCRYPT_SIGN'
          Error during the encrypt and sign operation

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_CONTEXT_SIGNER_KEY'
          Unable to create GPGME context for the signer key

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_SIGNER_KEYLIST_START'
          Error from signer keylist start operation

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_SIGNER_KEY_NOT_FOUND'
          The key for the given signer was not found

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_SIGNER_KEY_AMBIGUOUS'
          Ambiguous name/id for the signer key (mulitple matches)

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_ADD_SIGNER'
          Error adding the signer key to the gpgme context

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_CONTEXT_RECIPIENT_KEY'
          Unable to create GPGME context for the recipient key

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_RECIPIENT_KEYLIST_START'
          Error from signer keylist start operation

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_RECIPIENT_KEY_NOT_FOUND'
          The key for the given recipient was not found

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_RECIPIENT_KEY_AMBIGUOUS'
          Ambiguous name/id for the recipient key (mulitple matches)

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_DECRYPT_FAILED'
          Decryption operation failed

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_BAD_GPG_EXE'
          Unable to stat the given GPG executable

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_BAD_HOME_DIR'
          Unable to stat the given GPG home directory

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_SET_HOME_DIR'
          Unable to set the given GPG home directory

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_NO_SIGNATURE'
          Missing GPG signature

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_BAD_SIGNATURE'
          Bad GPG signature

    `FKO_ERROR_GPGME_SIGNATURE_VERIFY_DISABLED'
          Trying to check signature with verification disabled

   You can use the `IS_GPGME_ERROR(err_code)' macro to determine whether
or not an error id GPGME related.  If the macro evaluates to a true
value, you may be able to get additional information about the error
using the following function:

 -- Function: const char * fko_gpg_errstr (int ERR_CODE)
     The function `fko_errstr' returns a pointer to a statically
     allocated string containing the descripton of the GPGME error.

*Note*: For some errors, this function may return an empty string.

Appendix A GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*************************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

A.0.1 Preamble
--------------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.0.2 Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.
