Normally the test corpus in the test/afl/test-cases/ directory is sufficient
for effective AFL fuzzing rounds. However, if you want to test with an expanded
set of files that have gone through afl-cmin, then you can leverage the scripts
in this directory. This uses the complete set of main test suite config files
in the test/conf/ directory as the input corpus for afl-cmin. The work flow
would be (for the server-access.sh fuzzing wrapper for example):

$ cd fwknop.git/test/afl/
$ ./compile/afl-compile.sh
$ ./fuzzing-wrappers/helpers/afl-cmin/server-access-cmin.sh
$ ./fuzzing-wrappers/server-access.sh
