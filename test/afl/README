The fwknop project supports various fuzzing strategies, and one of the most
important is usage of the 'American Fuzzy Lop' (AFL) fuzzer written by Michal
Zalewski (see: https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop/). Because AFL is
not designed to handle encryption schemes (see the README included in the AFL
sources for more information on this), a special --enable-afl-fuzzing command
line switch is available to the fwknop autoconf configure script. This argument
allows encryption and base64 encoding to be bypassed when feeding SPA packet
data to fwknopd via stdin. It is the feature that enables AFL fuzzing.

This directory contains enabling scripts in order to make it easy to fuzz
fwknop with AFL. It is assumed that AFL is installed and in your path. The
files are in this directory are organized as follows:

afl-compile.sh   - Script to compile fwknop underneath afl-gcc.
afl-fuzzing.in   - AFL input directory which contains input test cases.
afl-fuzzing.out  - AFL output directory.
afl-run.sh       - Script to invoke AFL with proper command line arguments to
                   fwknopd for fuzzing enablement.

Here is an example of what fwknopd produces when compiled for AFL support when
a dummy SPA packet is provided in non-encoded/encrypted form via fwknopd's
stdin:

$ ./fwknopd-stdin-test.sh
