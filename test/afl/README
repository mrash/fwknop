-- Quick Start --

To get going with AFL fuzzing against fwknop:

$ ./compile/afl-compile.sh
$ ./fuzzing-wrappers/spa-pkts.sh

Output will be placed in fuzzing-output/server-conf.out/


-- More Information --

The fwknop project supports various fuzzing strategies, and one of the most
important is usage of the 'American Fuzzy Lop' (AFL) fuzzer written by Michal
Zalewski (see: http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/). Because AFL is not designed to
handle encryption schemes (see the README included in the AFL sources for more
information on this), a special --enable-afl-fuzzing command line switch is
available in the fwknop autoconf configure script. This argument allows
encryption and base64 encoding to be bypassed when feeding SPA packet data to
fwknopd via stdin. It is this feature that enables AFL fuzzing. One exception
to this is made when using AFL to fuzz the fwknoprc file that is leveraged by
the fwknop client - in this case, fwknop should not be compiled with
--enable-afl-fuzzing (use the compile/afl-compile-no-enable-arg.sh script).

The top level directory contains enabling scripts in order to make it easy to
fuzz fwknop with AFL. It is assumed that AFL is installed and in your path. The
files are in this directory are organized as follows:

fuzzing-wrappers/  - Directory that contains wrapper scripts for running AFL
                     against fwknop. All interaction with AFL should be done
                     with these scripts, and they should be executed from the
                     test/afl/ directory, e.g. "./fuzzing-wrappers/client-rc.sh"

test-cases/        - Directory for ALF test cases used by the wrapper scripts.
                     There are four areas in fwknop that are fuzzed: SPA packet
                     encoding/decoding, server access.conf and fwknopd.conf
                     parsing, and client fwknoprc file parsing.

compile/           - Directory for compilation scripts to ensure fwknop is
                     compiled underneath afl-gcc.

fuzzing-output/    - Results directory that is made underneath an AFL fuzzing
                     cycle.

Here is an example of what fwknopd produces when compiled for AFL support when
a dummy SPA packet is provided in non-encoded/encrypted form via fwknopd's
stdin:

$ ./fuzzing-wrappers/helpers/fwknopd-stdin-test.sh
